<p style="text-align: right">Tennyson Mountain, N. C.,<br />
October 6.</p>
<p><i>Carin</i>, <i>dear and far</i>:</p>
<p>So you are back at your beloved Vassar!&nbsp; Does it seem as
wonderful as it did last year?&nbsp; Or more so?&nbsp; More so, I
expect.&nbsp; You were a little lonely and strange last year, you
know.&nbsp; But now it will be different.&nbsp; The girls will
seem like old friends to you now that you are coming back to
them.&nbsp; But, Carin, girl, they cannot <i>possibly</i> be such
old friends as I am, or as Annie Laurie is.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t
dare to like one of them better than you like us.&nbsp; I can
imagine, and really spend too much time imagining, just how
lovely and cultivated and surprising some of them are.&nbsp; But,
please, aren&rsquo;t some of them quite stupid, too?&nbsp; I hope
so.&nbsp; <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>Annie Laurie hopes so.&nbsp; We want still to be the
brightest stars in your sky.</p>
<p>Lest you should think we are not, we keep polishing
ourselves.&nbsp; Annie Laurie, when she is not attending to her
dairy, will take university extension work.&nbsp; And I, your own
ever adoring, ever grateful Azalea, will keep hammering away at
the books that dear Barbara Summers lends, and Keefe
O&rsquo;Connor sends down from New York, and those that your own
library at the Shoals furnishes.</p>
<p>I have the heart to read, Carin, but not the time.&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s the truth.&nbsp; Or, come to think of it, perhaps it
is a matter of eyelids.&nbsp; I have a queer, self-closing
pair.&nbsp; If they would stay up after nine o&rsquo;clock at
night I could learn something.&nbsp; But, no, they appear to be
attached to a wheel or a ratchet in the clock, and when nine
strikes, down they go and down they stay.</p>
<p>What can I do?</p>
<p>Nothing, except kiss dearest Mother McBirney good night,
trying not to yawn in her face as I do it, and after paying my
respects to Father McBirney and &ldquo;brother&rdquo; Jim, slip
away up to my darling loft.</p>
<p>Now, there, Carin!&nbsp; You see I&rsquo;m nicer than <a
name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>your other
friends, more unusual and surprising.&nbsp; (You told me the last
time I saw you that you liked your friends to be unusual and
surprising.)&nbsp; Well, have you any other friend who goes up to
her bedroom by means of an outside pair of stairs and who sleeps
in a loft, with a tame bat for company?&nbsp; You have not, Carin
Carson, and you know it.&nbsp; And, Oh, how I love it!&nbsp;
Shall I ever have another room I love so well?&nbsp; The soft
noises of the night come purling down into it like a
stream.&nbsp; The stars of the northern sky shine into it.&nbsp;
The mountain-side is like a green curtain hanging before
it.&nbsp; When I get up in that little room, my doors and windows
wide to old Mount Tennyson&rsquo;s whispering side, I seem to
find my real self.&nbsp; Everything slips away from me except the
night and myself and&mdash;and God.</p>
<p>Dearest Carin, I am feeling rather serious.&nbsp; It is
because of something that I have just come to realize.&nbsp; Do
you remember how, at the end of our school-teaching up at Sunset
Gap three years ago, your father and mother offered to send me
away to school, and I&mdash;thanking them more than I could
possibly make them understand&mdash;refused?&nbsp; I said I
wanted it to be <a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>Azalea for herself.&nbsp; That I meant to spin my own
little web, and that I hoped it would be a silver one.</p>
<p>Since then, as you know, I have tried my best.&nbsp; I decided
that I would become a teacher of the mountain handicrafts; I
hoped that some day when good Mrs. Kitchell resigned her position
as head of the Mountain Industries which your father and mother
established, that I could take her place.&nbsp; What is more, I
wanted to develop the Industries so that they would become much,
much more useful and inspiring and important than they are
now.&nbsp; I wanted, too, to fit myself to meet all the people
who come to Lee&mdash;all the charming, gracious people.&nbsp;
You know how I have worked for all this.&nbsp; Haystack Thompson,
the best basket-maker in the country, has taught me to make
baskets.&nbsp; Mrs. Kitchell, the cleverest little weaver of all
the weavers, has instructed me in the weaving of woolen and linen
and cotton cloth, and in the making of counterpanes, as well as
the knotting of fringe and the looping of fancy edges.&nbsp;
Mother McBirney has taught me knitting and lace making and
crocheting.&nbsp; I can do a little wood carving.&nbsp; I <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>can make
mats.&nbsp; I can weave carpets.&nbsp; Even, if put to it, I can
turn a jug.&nbsp; Then I have read and studied and thought.&nbsp;
And in doing all that I have grown vain and foolish.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you how I found out.</p>
<p>Dear Father McBirney isn&rsquo;t well.&nbsp; I think I spoke
about this to you the other day.&nbsp; But he&rsquo;s been
getting rapidly worse, and now he can hardly move from his
chair.&nbsp; It is rheumatism; and it&rsquo;s likely to stay with
him for a long, long time.&nbsp; He cannot help about the farm at
all, and so all of the farm work falls on Jim.&nbsp; He
can&rsquo;t even go about the country to collect the chairs the
mountaineers make for the Mountain Industries, as he promised
your father he would.</p>
<p>Oh, Carin, do you remember the day you and your father and
mother came up to our cabin to ask my foster-parents to go down
and take charge of the Industries?&nbsp; And do you remember how
Pa and Ma looked about at the darling cabin with its wistaria and
trumpet vine, and its Pride of India tree with the graves of
their little Molly and my own dear mama beneath it, and how they
would not go?&nbsp; And then do you recall how Father McBirney <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>promised to
&ldquo;beat up trade&rdquo; for the Industries, and so we all
stayed in the cabin with its nice open room in between the closed
ones, and its own queer little smithy, and its beehives on the
south slope, and its martin houses by the door?&nbsp; Oh, the
dear, dear little house!</p>
<p>Well, there has been such a demand for the mountain chairs
from the visitors to Lee, that the chair-makers have been making
a good profit and Father McBirney has been enjoying a nice
commission.&nbsp; This winter he quite depended on it, because,
owing to his bad health, he hadn&rsquo;t been able to do as much
with the farm as usual.&nbsp; But now he isn&rsquo;t well enough
to go over the mountains arranging about the chairs, or getting
them together, so even that little profit is denied us.</p>
<p>What are we to do?&nbsp; Jim may be able to do some hauling
for people; there&rsquo;s wood to be carted, and some work to do
for the miller, but it&rsquo;s very irregular.</p>
<p>And this is where I come in.&nbsp; This is where I am shown up
as a person with much vanity and little common sense.&nbsp; For,
of course, it should be my part to make ready money for the
family.&nbsp; And I can&rsquo;t.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know
how.&nbsp; <a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>I have been thinking I was so capable, and now I see
I&rsquo;m just as useless as&mdash;as most girls!</p>
<p>Of course I could go away somewhere else and perhaps find some
other place where the mountain industries are being
developed.&nbsp; But ought I to leave home now?&nbsp; I seem to
be very much needed.&nbsp; As you know, sometimes our sweet,
unselfish Mother McBirney gets melancholy.&nbsp; She has lived so
long away up here on the mountain that her thoughts get to
turning inward, and she remembers about Molly&rsquo;s death, and
then for days she is silent and brooding, and we all tremble for
her.&nbsp; She looks far, far away and pays almost no attention
to what we say to her.&nbsp; This is a very real danger, and if I
were not here to shake her out of these moods, who knows what
might happen?</p>
<p>So there I am, I who wanted to do such wonderful independent
things, I who thought I had learned so much, about as useless as
anyone could be.&nbsp; At least, as a money-earner.&nbsp; Of
course I am not sitting about, beating my breast and throwing
dust on my head.&nbsp; I hope you don&rsquo;t think that.&nbsp;
No, I have Mother McBirney&rsquo;s loom in good working order,
and have set it up not too far away from the <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>fireplace,
and I am throwing that shuttle like mad, weaving some perfectly
fascinating counterpanes.&nbsp; You ought to see the one in red
and black in the Tudor rose pattern.&nbsp; Truly, it&rsquo;s a
beauty.&nbsp; I know I can sell it easily enough, and I&rsquo;m
going to charge a good price for it, too.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a
greedy pig.</p>
<p>But you see, I <i>must</i> have money.</p>
<p>By rights, Father McBirney ought to have a change.&nbsp; He
should go down to Bethal Springs.&nbsp; The waters there are said
to cure some terrible cases of rheumatism.&nbsp; But he
couldn&rsquo;t go without Mother; and Mother wouldn&rsquo;t go
without Jim.&nbsp; So there you are.&nbsp; Such a puzzle!</p>
<p>Jim is dreadfully on my mind, too.&nbsp; What do you think has
happened to him?&nbsp; He has &ldquo;got religion.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Yes, I know you are laughing.&nbsp; Jim, the tease of the world,
Jim with freckles and warts and funny words, and the very
<i>dickens</i> in him.&nbsp; But it is true.&nbsp; Mr. Summers
did it&mdash;talked to him in the woods, and Jim &ldquo;saw the
light.&rdquo;&nbsp; And now he wants to be a preacher like Mr.
Summers.&nbsp; You ought to hear him preaching to the horses when
he combs them down.&nbsp; I listen.&nbsp; Perhaps I ought not
to.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t do it to make fun, you may <a
name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>be
sure.&nbsp; I do it because the poor boy is so earnest and
surprising.&nbsp; You can&rsquo;t think what beautiful things he
says.&nbsp; Nights he studies the Bible and some books Mr.
Summers gives him.&nbsp; He drives away to town once every week
to help with the Epworth League meeting, and he has got up some
sort of a society among the boys, and has induced the members to
pledge themselves not to drink whiskey or chew tobacco, or use
profane words, or do any other horrid thing.</p>
<p>Our Jim!</p>
<p>Carin, we&rsquo;re all growing up, aren&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>You with your long dresses and touch-me-not air, and Annie
Laurie, one of our leading business persons!&nbsp; And Sam
Disbrow buying stock in Annie Laurie&rsquo;s dairy, and Hi
Kitchell doing draying, and Dick Heller going in the bank, and
Keefe O&rsquo;Connor sending me the catalogue of his
&ldquo;Autumn Exhibit.&rdquo;&nbsp; You can fancy how Keefe
played up Sunset Gap in his pictures!&nbsp; I could tell from the
names where he had painted about half of them.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
send you the catalogue.&nbsp; But return it, won&rsquo;t
you?&nbsp; It seems like a memento of that queer, wild, happy
summer at the Gap.</p>
<p><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>That
was the last summer we really spent together.&nbsp; To be sure I
have had glimpses of you, but usually you have been away on your
wonderful journeys with your father and mother, and I have had to
go about the mountain roads alone.&nbsp; But I haven&rsquo;t
minded, Carin, and you mustn&rsquo;t think that I have.&nbsp; I
tried to picture the beautiful places you were in, and the
parties you were going to, and the pictures and palaces you were
seeing, and I knew that if I was thinking of you, that you were
thinking of me, too.&nbsp; It kept my heart warm; it peopled the
lonely mountain roads.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you this, my Carin: Next to a well-loved human
face, a well-loved road is the best thing.&nbsp; The sight of a
familiar clump of grass can be as dear as a threshold.&nbsp;
Twists of tree trunks, odd embankments, colors of the road, above
all, the turns of a road, get to be like a part of one&rsquo;s
life.&nbsp; The little smells that come up from earth and grass
and flower, rising over and over again from the same place,
affect one almost like the voices of &ldquo;home
folk.&rdquo;&nbsp; Even the wind on the face, though the wind is
so wild and strange a thing, makes one feel at ease in
one&rsquo;s world; and the burst of the <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>sun over a
hill, or the going down of it at the close of a busy
day&mdash;busy both for you and the sun&mdash;can make you
realize as few things can, that you are the child of God&mdash;of
the great Father, so silent, so unknowable, who has made suns and
birds, mountains and little friendly crickets.</p>
<p>Oh, beautiful, beautiful life!&nbsp; In spite of trouble and
sickness, perplexity and poverty, beautiful, beautiful life!</p>
<p>Dear Carin, don&rsquo;t laugh at me if my letter has been a
bit too ecstatic.&nbsp; You are surrounded all the time with fine
teachers and brilliant friends, and moving, shifting life.&nbsp;
I am just here by myself, so to speak.&nbsp; Yes, yes, dear, I
know my own McBirneys are beside me.&nbsp; I have no desire
deeper than the desire to help them.&nbsp; Yet, Carin, are they
my kind of people?&nbsp; You know they are not; they know
it.&nbsp; We try to be alike, but we cannot be, really.</p>
<p>I am the granddaughter of Colonel Atherton on one side; the
granddaughter of some other proud old gentleman on the other
side.&nbsp; For it was pride that made my grandfather Knox turn
his son, my father, adrift.&nbsp; True, the McBirneys took me, a
little ragged wanderer, <a name="page20"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 20</span>orphaned and desolate, from a
traveling show; but that was an accident in my life.&nbsp; It
cannot change the fact that I have the tastes of the Athertons
and the Knoxes, who have loved beauty and hospitality and other
gracious things.</p>
<p>Oh, me, am I insinuating that Mother McBirney is not
hospitable or that she does not love beauty?&nbsp; If so, shame
on me.&nbsp; Her door stands open to every wanderer.&nbsp; It
stood open to me.&nbsp; The flowers about her walls, and the
purple valley below her hill, delight her.&nbsp; Yes, she is a
true lover of beauty.&nbsp; May we never lose sight of each
other, and to the last may I feel her hand waiting to grasp mine
in whatever darkness she or I may have to walk through.&nbsp; I
only say I wish I might, sometimes, have someone like you, my
Carin, to talk with.&nbsp; Of course, there is Barbara
Summers.&nbsp; But she is in the valley and I on the
mountain.</p>
<p>Equally of course, there are Keefe O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s
letters.&nbsp; And there are yours.&nbsp; Be sure you send me one
soon.</p>
<p>Do not mind my changing moods.&nbsp; I am, after all, always
the same old</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Azalea</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>P.
S.&nbsp; This is the evening of the same day.</p>
<p>Who do you think called?</p>
<p>Mrs. Kitchell, Hi&rsquo;s little brown mother, all in new
clothes, with white cotton gloves on her hands&mdash;the hands
that used to be so hard and scratched and battered with
work.&nbsp; She had a red rose on her new fall hat, and her shoes
were blacked.&nbsp; And you know what shoes are at Lee!&nbsp; The
standard is low, owing to red mud and lack of elbow
activity.&nbsp; But Mrs. Kitchell was grand.&nbsp; There is no
other word for it.</p>
<p>This, however, is not the most exciting part of what I have to
tell.&nbsp; Haystack Thompson was with her, and he actually wore
a hat.&nbsp; Yes, he did too, Carin Carson.&nbsp; What is more,
his hair had been cut&mdash;a little.&nbsp; But you could get
seven crops a year of his hair, just as you can of alfalfa.&nbsp;
He, too, was wonderful.&nbsp; He wore a collar.&nbsp; It was of
celluloid, and it shone like Mother McBirney&rsquo;s best milk
pan.&nbsp; He did not bring his fiddle, and that made me feel
sad.&nbsp; If he wants to court Hi&rsquo;s &ldquo;ma,&rdquo; why
let him, but is that any reason why he should turn his back on
his faithful Betsy, his fiddle?</p>
<p>I felt like saying to him: &ldquo;Haystack, <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>Haystack, can
any woman understand you, answer you, listen to you, rejoice with
you, as your fiddle did?&nbsp; Will any woman cost you so
little?&nbsp; Ask so few questions?&nbsp; Be such a companion on
rainy and sunshiny days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But of course I didn&rsquo;t say anything of the kind.&nbsp;
Little Mrs. Kitchell is a brave creature, and Haystack is a
lonely one.&nbsp; So if they decide to marry, I and everyone else
ought to be glad.&nbsp; The only thing that really troubles me is
how they are going to live.&nbsp; Dear Haystack never earns any
money, except in little driblets, making baskets or playing at
dances.&nbsp; Do you suppose that after that little beaver, Mrs.
Kitchell, has reared a family of four, alone and unaided, that
she&rsquo;ll turn in and support Haystack in his old age?&nbsp;
Wouldn&rsquo;t that be odd of her?&nbsp; Still, perhaps she might
like it.&nbsp; Hi, as I say, is &ldquo;draying.&rdquo;&nbsp; He
has a pair of claybank mules and he is a proud man, I can tell
you.&nbsp; He works quite as hard as anybody in Lee&mdash;harder
than most.&nbsp; But he doesn&rsquo;t like to be
&ldquo;driv.&rdquo;&nbsp; You know he wouldn&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will that trunk be up to the house,
expressman?&rdquo; the Northerners say, not so much as looking at
him.</p>
<p><a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Then
you ought to hear Hi drawl.&nbsp; You know his drawl!&nbsp; But
it&rsquo;s grown worse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sometime along in the forenoon, I reckon,
ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you sure of it?&nbsp; Because if you
aren&rsquo;t, I shall get another man to bring it up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yessum.&nbsp; Only I&rsquo;m the only one in town jest
now that does trunk haulin&rsquo;.&nbsp; But don&rsquo;t you
worry, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; I feel tollable sure that there trunk
will git up to you-all&rsquo;s house some time before
evenin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You can just hear the Northerners pant when he says that.</p>
<p>I know you and your people are Northerners, Carin, dear, but
you&rsquo;re not the snap-turtle variety.</p>
<p>I do wish you&rsquo;d been down here this summer.&nbsp; I had
so much to tell you.&nbsp; The Shoals looked very lonely with
none of you in it.&nbsp; Was it so lovely up there in Maine that
you forgot our purple mountains?&nbsp; I know it must be
beautiful up there.&nbsp; I look at the map, and follow all the
queer little inlets and outlets, and think how bright the water
must be as it breaks on the rocks.</p>
<p>Well, we have had wonderful things to look <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>at
ourselves.&nbsp; Why, only to-day the mountains looked like
gigantic plums, with rich purple bloom all over them; and the sky
went to the trouble to try to match them.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;d
have enjoyed it more if I hadn&rsquo;t been so poor.&nbsp; Not
that I&rsquo;m any poorer than usual, but I feel poorer because I
see that at last it is &ldquo;up to me&rdquo; to be the
money-maker.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t know how to begin.</p>
<p>I have explained to you distinctly a number of times, my dear
Carin, that when I write this way I do it to ease my
feelings.&nbsp; I want your advice.&nbsp; But that is all I do
want of you, except, of course, your love and sympathy.&nbsp; I
know you ache to play fairy godmother.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ve tried
to do that many times.&nbsp; But I think you understand pretty
well by now that that wouldn&rsquo;t really help me out.&nbsp; I
want my own fight, my own life, my own victories.&nbsp; Just at
present I&rsquo;m terribly puzzled, because I want to help Father
and Mother McBirney and Jim.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t write it all to Keefe, because&mdash;well
because he might be able to think of a way to help me out, but
not of a way to help the others.&nbsp; Keefe is terribly
impulsive, and he will not realize how young he is.&nbsp; He is
disgracefully <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>young.&nbsp; So am I.&nbsp; That extreme youthfulness of
ours gets in the way of some of his plans.&nbsp; No, I
can&rsquo;t write him.&nbsp; He isn&rsquo;t sensible.&nbsp;
Perhaps that is one of the reasons he paints so well.&nbsp; Did I
tell you he was making rather a specialty of portraits?&nbsp; He
sent me one of a young Jewish girl who is in his color class at
the Academy of Design.&nbsp; He says her name is Miriam.&nbsp;
She fits the name.</p>
<p>Keefe wants to come down here this winter, but I&rsquo;m not
going to let him.&nbsp; There is no reason why he should come to
this one place out of all the places in the world.&nbsp; Let him
go up to Sunset Gap to his own wonderful little sister, Mary
Cecily Rowantree.&nbsp; He says he needs inspiration, but if
anyone can give it to him, she can.&nbsp; You see, if he came
here, he would be terribly interrupting, and I cannot and will
not be interrupted.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to earn the living for
the family, though, as I said at the beginning, I don&rsquo;t
know how.</p>
<p>Carin, I go out and sit down beside my dear little
mama&rsquo;s grave and think and think.&nbsp; I tell her how good
these people were to her, how good they have been to me ever
since that terrible day when I was left alone, and I beg <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>her if she is
indeed a spirit now, who can see and understand the things that
are hidden from us earth-bound ones, that she will put something
into my heart to tell me what to do.</p>
<p>I am ready, Carin, to prove myself.&nbsp; Here I am with my
strong body, with my heart full to bursting with gratitude and
love, with my waiting hands and brain.&nbsp; But I need
direction.&nbsp; You couldn&rsquo;t give me that, could you, dear
yellow-headed one?</p>
<p>Yes, I wish you might have come home this summer.&nbsp; It
would have helped.&nbsp; Barbara Summers was away, too.&nbsp; She
went home to see her people for the first time since she was
married.&nbsp; You remember her people didn&rsquo;t approve of
her marriage.&nbsp; She had a very happy time, and all is well
between her and them at last.&nbsp; Of Annie Laurie I see
little.&nbsp; She is too busy.&nbsp; But we signal each other,
she from her roof, I from the &ldquo;Outlook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Good-bye, dear.&nbsp; If I write you too much, forgive
me.&nbsp; I need to write.&nbsp; It comforts me.&nbsp; You
understand all I say&mdash;all I do not say, too.</p>

27</span>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">NEW RELATIONS</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Little Windows,&rdquo; Mount
Hebron, N. C.,<br />
October 20th.</p>
<p><i>Dearest Carin</i>:</p>
<p>Yes, the letter is from Azalea, though she is in a place that
neither you nor she ever heard of before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Windows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Are you wondering what they are, or what it is?</p>
<p>It is the name of a cottage on the top of Mount Hebron.&nbsp;
You have seen Hebron, looking like a cloud, from the top of our
own Mount Tennyson.</p>
<p>The cottage belongs to Mr. and Mrs. David Knox, and, Oh,
Carin, they&mdash;</p>
<p>But I must begin at the beginning.</p>
<p>In my last letter I told you how wretched Father McBirney was
feeling.&nbsp; Well, he grew worse and worse, till at last he did
not know <a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>a
moment when he was free from pain.&nbsp; Jim and I tried to keep
things going, but it was hard.&nbsp; We began to grow anxious
about money and the bare necessaries.&nbsp; Then I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going out to see about the mountain
chairs.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going to ride Paprika over the mountains
and get up the contracts with the chair-makers.&nbsp; Then, if
they&rsquo;ll not haul them to market, Jim must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mother objected.&nbsp; So did Father.&nbsp; I reminded them
how they had always said that a woman was perfectly safe in these
mountains.&nbsp; But it was different, it seemed, when the woman
was their own girl.&nbsp; However, I overcame their objections,
and one rainy morning I set forth on my pony with my saddlebags
well packed with food and clothing, and with carefully written
directions from Father McBirney in my pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stick to them there orders,&rdquo; said Pa, &ldquo;and
you can&rsquo;t go wrong, Zalie.&nbsp; Except, maybe at the
Trillers.&nbsp; I said for you to go to where the branch turns by
the two black gums, but it might so be that Triller has cut down
them gums.&nbsp; Seems as if he can&rsquo;t take no rest while
there&rsquo;s a tree standin&rsquo; around his place.&nbsp; But
<a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>anyhow, if
you follow the branch after it takes a bend&mdash;that is to say,
after you have taken the right-hand road turning off from the
Session&rsquo;s pike&mdash;then you can&rsquo;t a-miss
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t mean to miss it,&rdquo; I declared.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you worry, you two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim wasn&rsquo;t at home.&nbsp; I made a point of going while
he was down at Lee with some timber.&nbsp; He never would have
let me go in peace.</p>
<p>I was not at all afraid.&nbsp; Indeed, I was very happy.&nbsp;
I grew up on the road, as you remember, Carin.&nbsp; It
isn&rsquo;t as if I always had been house-bound.&nbsp; The woods
were very still and lovely, with gray veils falling in among the
trees, and the distance all hidden.&nbsp; The great tree trunks
with their green moss and their lichen looked beautiful.&nbsp; I
had been feeling a little gray in my mind, and the day just
suited me.</p>
<p>By noon, though, I was chilly and rather miserable, though my
raincoat kept me dry enough.&nbsp; But I was longing for a house,
as you may well imagine, and just then, sure enough, I saw a tiny
cabin in a clearing.&nbsp; I slipped off Paprika, and knocked at
the door.&nbsp; No one answered.&nbsp; A smell of wood smoke <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>came out from
the chimney and I knew there was a fire inside, and I did want
awfully to sit by it.&nbsp; Really, my teeth were
chattering.&nbsp; So I tried the door.&nbsp; It was not locked,
and I went in and crouched before the fire in the great blackened
fireplace.&nbsp; It was very homy, with its great kettle of soup
hanging over the coals, and its comfortable mountain chairs,
thickly padded with cushions covered with butternut
homespun.&nbsp; There were braided rugs on the floor, and in the
darkest corner, one lofty bedstead with posts and a wonderful
pieced bedquilt.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t go so far as to say that
everything was <i>outrageously</i> clean, but on the other hand,
it was not disagreeably unclean&mdash;just an easy medium.&nbsp;
Anyway, the fire was a blessing and the soup a temptation.</p>
<p>So what do you think I did?</p>
<p>Yielded to temptation, of course.&nbsp; I dished myself out a
good helping of the soup, took some of my own bread from my lunch
box, and ate till I was satisfied.&nbsp; Meantime, I had got as
warm as toast and felt as if I had lived in that house
forever.&nbsp; Then I took a little snapshot picture of myself
from my notebook and laid it on the table with some loaf sugar,
<a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>some
coffee and a fine piece of Mother McBirney&rsquo;s honey cake,
and wrote:</p>
<blockquote><p><i>This is the picture of the girl who sat by your
fire and ate some of your soup</i>.&nbsp; <i>It is the first time
she ever helped herself to anything</i>, <i>but she enjoyed it so
much that she means to stop again the next time she is passing
and see if there is some more of that delicious soup and to ask
how it is made</i>.&nbsp; <i>Here are some little presents</i>,
<i>which please accept</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Azalea McBirney</i>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, this is just an incident, and I only mention it to show
you what a happy time I had at the beginning.&nbsp; I could not
dream how things would change with me.</p>
<p>In the early afternoon I visited two of the houses to which I
was to go, and arranged about the number and kinds of chairs the
men were to furnish.&nbsp; I drew up contracts for them to sign,
for I thought that would be businesslike.&nbsp; Anyway, it
pleased me to do it, and I think the chair-makers liked it
too.&nbsp; It gave both of us a nice efficient feeling.&nbsp;
They wanted me to stay at the last house I visited, and there was
such a darling little baby there that I almost did, but I decided
that I&rsquo;d better be <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>getting on and try to reach the
Triller&rsquo;s before sundown.&nbsp; Paprika was getting a bit
fagged, but I know how quickly she rests up, so I hurried her
along, getting, I confess, just a trifle worried as I found
myself on strange roads, with the mist settling all about me.</p>
<p>It was very still.&nbsp; The mist seemed to muffle
everything.&nbsp; No birds were singing, and I could not hear any
creature in the woods, nor any falling water, and as there was no
wind, the trees were motionless.&nbsp; Everything rested under a
gray enchantment, and it gave me a very strange feeling.&nbsp;
Yet I liked it.&nbsp; I felt as if something were going to
happen.</p>
<p>And something did.&nbsp; But, Carin, it was not in the least
what I would have imagined or wished for.&nbsp; It was as
different as it could possibly be.</p>
<p>I have said that everything was very still&mdash;Oh, perfectly
still.&nbsp; Then came a noise from afar, like a gathering wind,
yet not a leaf stirred on the trees.&nbsp; The sound grew louder
and louder.&nbsp; It seemed like a tempest.&nbsp; I trembled and
so did Paprika.&nbsp; A moment later around the turn of the gray
road came a sort of monster&mdash;an awful thing, all snout and
<a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>flaming
eyes.&nbsp; I knew in one terrible second what it was, of
course.</p>
<p>An automobile&mdash;the first I ever had seen, face to face
and eye to eye.&nbsp; Paprika, who had not looked at pictures to
any great extent&mdash;except, perhaps, those on bill
boards&mdash;did not know at all what it was.&nbsp; She gave one
wild scream like a wounded horse and dashed straight up the
bank.&nbsp; Then she looked back over her shoulder as if doubting
her senses, saw the horrible thing again, heard its roaring and
snuffling, and plunged on.&nbsp; There in the thick of the woods,
with the mist still gathering, I could not see how to guide her,
and anyway, she was beyond management.&nbsp; So, in a moment more
I felt myself&mdash;I who never had been thrown in my
life&mdash;going over her head.</p>
<p>And that was all, Carin dear, for four days, so they tell
me.&nbsp; Four days.</p>
<p>You will wonder where I was when I opened my eyes.&nbsp; This
letter paper will tell you.&nbsp; I was, and I am, at
&ldquo;Little Windows,&rdquo; which is the name, as I have
already explained, of a cottage on the top of Mount Hebron.&nbsp;
Of course I can not say for sure that it is the <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>loveliest
place in the world, for I have seen but few places, not being
like you, Carin, darling, forever going to beautiful spots.&nbsp;
But at any rate it is lovely beyond my power to describe, with
its great valleys and gulches, and its near acquaintance with
stars and sun risings and moon settings.</p>
<p>When first I opened my eyes I was in a quiet bedroom.&nbsp;
The walls were silver gray, and of wood.&nbsp; There were no
pictures.&nbsp; The little windows were without curtains and
looked right out at the wonderful world.&nbsp; It was sunset and
from where I lay I could see it, crimson as the banners of a
king.&nbsp; I could hear a fire leaping and rejoicing in some
room beyond, and voices&mdash;two voices.&nbsp; A man and a woman
were talking together, rather anxiously, I thought.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are talking of me,&rdquo; I decided.&nbsp; And
then I began to remember.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is my neck broken?&rdquo; I asked myself.&nbsp; And I
wriggled it.&nbsp; It wriggled in the good old way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my back!&rdquo; I decided.&nbsp; So I tried
to sit up.&nbsp; I was pretty dizzy, but my back worked
perfectly.&nbsp; I tried both legs and both arms.&nbsp; They were
just as active as I could wish.&nbsp; I <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>poked my
ribs.&nbsp; They appeared to be in their right places.&nbsp; And
then I grew frightfully weary.&nbsp; I wanted to cry, yet I felt
it would be too much of an effort.&nbsp; It seemed as if I were
sinking down, down through gray mist.&nbsp; Everything floated
away from before me, and I knew nothing more for a time.</p>
<p>Then somebody brought in a light.&nbsp; It was not a very
large or a very bright light, but it managed to reach the queer,
shadowy place where I was living, and to make me open my
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; I heard myself
saying.</p>
<p>The lady who carried the lamp nearly dropped it.&nbsp; But she
controlled herself and set it on a table.&nbsp; Then she came and
hung over me and said in a voice that trembled:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very well, thank you.&nbsp; How are
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>We have both laughed about it since&mdash;about our speaking
to each other in that queer formal way.&nbsp; But we had to make
some sort of a beginning, and perhaps that was as good as
any.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am all right, thank you, ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tried myself all over a while ago, and there
is nothing broken.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;there is nothing
broken.&rdquo;&nbsp; But she looked at me doubtfully, and with a
queer kind of curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember that you were hurt?&rdquo; she
asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;That you were thrown from your horse and
hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My pony?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is she
well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, she&rsquo;s all right.&nbsp; She wasn&rsquo;t
hurt.&nbsp; But you were, and my husband&mdash;it was his machine
that frightened your pony&mdash;picked you up and brought you
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; Then I began to wish
she would go away and leave me alone.&nbsp; I wanted to go back
into that queer, gray, silent place of mine again, where sort of
shadowy things went by in a long procession, without one of them
stopping to bother me with questions.&nbsp; I did think I would
enjoy looking at the lady and see what she was like, but I was
too lazy and so I decided I would do that another time.&nbsp;
Only I could see that she was tall, that her hair was golden, and
that she was very thin.&nbsp; That seemed enough for the present;
so I closed my eyes.</p>
<p>Then presently I felt someone putting <a
name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>something
between my lips.&nbsp; It was soup.&nbsp; And that made me
laugh.&nbsp; I thought about the house where I had helped myself
to the soup.&nbsp; I had liked it better than this&mdash;it had
had more flavor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you laughing about?&rdquo; asked the lady.</p>
<p>I felt terribly silly.&nbsp; I remembered something from
&ldquo;Alice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Soup of the evening, beautiful soup,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; Then I laughed some more.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t
quit.&nbsp; Suddenly I heard a voice roaring:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I stopped and looked to see who had spoken to me that
way.&nbsp; It was a tall man&mdash;a terribly tall man.&nbsp; The
shadow of him ran along the floor for yards and doubled up on the
ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp; I was quite
angry.</p>
<p>Then he bowed&mdash;and you ought to have seen that shadow bow
at the same time.&nbsp; It was the funniest thing, and it nearly
set me off again, but I crumpled up the sheet in my hands and
squeezed it as hard as I could to keep from giggling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David Knox,&rdquo; said the gentleman, &ldquo;who <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>was
unfortunate enough to be the cause of all of your
trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad to meet you,&rdquo; I said politely.&nbsp;
His bow was so nice I forgave him for yelling: &ldquo;Stop
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lorena,&rdquo; he said under his voice, &ldquo;I think
everything is going to be all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now you wouldn&rsquo;t think that remark would make me laugh,
would you?&nbsp; Oh, Carin, I&rsquo;m so ashamed of it, now I
remember.&nbsp; But I began to sing:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The years roll slowly by, Lorena,&rsquo;&rdquo;
and then when I couldn&rsquo;t think of the next line I cried:
&ldquo;Why doesn&rsquo;t somebody tell me what comes
next?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, they told me if I didn&rsquo;t keep still they would go
out and leave me alone.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t want to be left
alone, because just then I took a sort of turn and was afraid to
sink down into that gray, still place where I had been.&nbsp; So
I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, please stay, please stay, and I will tell you why I
laughed at the soup.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So before they could stop me I had told them about it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some day,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I am going back and <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>call on that
woman.&nbsp; I will give her some patterns for weaving, and maybe
she will have some old, old ones that she will give
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you weave?&rdquo; asked the lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
are very young and&mdash;and not a mountain girl, are
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m a mountain girl,&rdquo; I said,
remembering back just as far as dear Mother McBirney and the
cabin with my bedroom in the loft.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Azalea
McBirney of Tennyson Mountain, and I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m a
weaver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Azalea,&rdquo; murmured the lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;That was
the name of poor Jack&rsquo;s wife, wasn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; I
always thought it a sweet name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Something shot through my brain.&nbsp; It was like a stroke of
lightning.&nbsp; It was the strangest thing that ever happened to
me.&nbsp; In a second, by some power I can&rsquo;t explain, I
began to know things.&nbsp; I saw them as if they were a
vision.&nbsp; I sat right up in bed, and pushed my hair back from
my face.&nbsp; I recollect that I kept pushing it back and
pushing it back, as if it got in between me and what I wanted to
understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What Jack?&nbsp; What Jack?&rdquo; I demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack Knox, my dead brother,&rdquo; said the man <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>soothingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;No one you know I am sure, my
dear.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t excite yourself, please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jack Knox!&nbsp; Jack Knox!&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That was the man that married my little mama and left her
to care for me alone.&nbsp; Jack Knox!&nbsp; No, I don&rsquo;t
know him.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t remember him at all.&nbsp; And
I&rsquo;m glad of it.&nbsp; Jack Knox!&nbsp; Jack
Knox!&rdquo;</p>
<p>You know it isn&rsquo;t like me, Carin, to feel angry at
anyone.&nbsp; But my mind seemed to have no resistance.&nbsp;
Whatever idea got into it insisted on raging around in it.&nbsp;
I couldn&rsquo;t stop it.&nbsp; I was ashamed, and yet I
couldn&rsquo;t manage myself.</p>
<p>I felt the lady, Mrs. Knox, taking hold of me with those long,
soft, cool hands of hers and forcing me back on the bed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lie still,&rdquo; she begged.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do lie
still, Miss Azalea.&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t care about
anything.&nbsp; No one shall do you any harm, and we&rsquo;ll not
even let troublesome ideas come near you if we can help
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you not say,&rdquo; said the gentleman, &ldquo;that
your name was McBirney?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, McBirney.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you know Ma and
Pa McBirney?&nbsp; Why, everyone knows them.&nbsp; They take
orphans in.&nbsp; At least they <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>took me in.&nbsp; They would have
taken my little mama in, only she was dead, so they put her
beneath the Pride of India tree beside their own Molly.&nbsp; You
can go see for yourself.&nbsp; You will know the house by the
Pride of India tree and the gourds before the door.&nbsp; The
gourds are for the martins&mdash;dozens and dozens of
martins.&nbsp; The martins will show you the way if you
like.&nbsp; Or the bees&mdash;thousands of bees.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush, hush,&rdquo; whispered the lady.&nbsp;
&ldquo;David, go and take the light.&nbsp; Hush, Azalea,
hush.&nbsp; It is all right.&nbsp; Your little mama would want
you to hush.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She began singing the song with her own name in it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The years roll slowly by, Lorena.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I went to sleep.&nbsp; But this time it was different.&nbsp; I
did not seem to be sinking into that chilly gray place where the
visions were.&nbsp; I just went to sleep the way I ought.</p>
<p>The next morning when I awoke I was quite sensible and
calm.&nbsp; I saw the world as it was, and remembered all my
life, and knew that I had come by a strange, strange chance,
among my dead father&rsquo;s people.&nbsp; David Knox was his <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>elder
brother, and Lorena Knox, with her yellow hair and her long cool
hands, was David&rsquo;s wife.&nbsp; It made me deeply
satisfied&mdash;not exactly happy, but deeply satisfied.</p>
<p>I ate the breakfast they brought me, and after a while I was
taken out into the sitting room.&nbsp; It was a beautiful room,
large and square and quiet, with a great fireplace of gray stone,
and more little uncurtained windows looking out at the green and
purple world.&nbsp; So then I sat up and looked at these
people.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have never before seen anyone save my little poor
mama who belonged to me,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is very
strange, to be here with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like it?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Knox.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a little afraid,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I want you to like me and I am afraid you may
not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but why?&nbsp; We already do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you?&nbsp; Oh, I&rsquo;m glad.&nbsp; Life has
been&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How has it been?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lonesome, sometimes.&nbsp; Interesting, of course, and
nice, but lonesome.&nbsp; I was always taking favors from other
people.&nbsp; I had no one of my own.&nbsp; There was
only&mdash;only the Pride <a name="page43"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 43</span>of India tree with mama under
it.&nbsp; I used to go out and talk to it, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush,&rdquo; said the lady.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do not weep,
Azalea.&nbsp; Save all your strength for our sakes.&nbsp; I
cannot doubt that what you tell me is true.&nbsp; I want you to
see something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She brought me a little album open at the face of a young
man.&nbsp; Carin, darling, when I looked at it, I knew it was the
face of my father.&nbsp; It was like my own face, only a
man&rsquo;s and bolder.&nbsp; And yet, so like!</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father!&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I never saw his
face before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is wonderfully like your own,&rdquo; said Mr.
Knox.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now you must call me your Uncle David,
Azalea; and you must call my dear wife your Aunt Lorena.&nbsp;
Remember, you must never feel lonely any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I suddenly thought of Mother McBirney waiting for me, and
watching and watching the road, and praying and wondering, and I
cried out:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear Mother McBirney!&nbsp; I can never leave
her&mdash;never!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But someone else has a claim on you now,&rdquo; said my
Uncle David.&nbsp; Carin, think of having <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>a right
really to write that: &ldquo;My Uncle David!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not mean your Aunt Lorena and myself,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mean that you have a grandmother and that it
will be the happiest hour of her old age when she takes the
daughter of her favorite son in her arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a grandmother?&nbsp; A grandmother of my
own?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed you have, and a very wonderful and proud old
lady she is.&nbsp; The grief of her life was the waywardness of
her son.&nbsp; She cannot realize that he is dead.&nbsp; We have
to watch her lest she steal out to meet him in secret as she did
in the old days when his father turned him from home.&nbsp; She
used to creep from the house to meet him and to take him money,
for she lived in the light of his handsome countenance.&nbsp; So
it is your duty, Azalea, to go to her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A grandmother,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;of my very
own!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed wonderful&mdash;like having a mother, only more
majestic.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t explain what I felt.</p>
<p><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>And I
can&rsquo;t write any more just now, darling Carin.&nbsp; My aunt
has kept warning me that I must put my pen down.&nbsp; So I
obey.&nbsp; Another day you shall know the rest.</p>

<p><i>Carin dear</i>:</p>
<p>I was not quite so well after writing you.&nbsp; Aunt Lorena
says I mustn&rsquo;t write so much at one time again till I am
stronger.&nbsp; This is just to say that Mother McBirney has been
sent for, though I can&rsquo;t see how she is to leave
home.&nbsp; Who will look after the men?&nbsp; Oh, how I am
needed in that little house!&nbsp; And here I lie in this

sleepy!&nbsp; I never dreamed anyone could be so sleepy.</p>
<p>When I dream now, it is all about my grandmother.&nbsp; To
think of an own grandmother!&nbsp; In my dreams she comes
creeping softly into the room and strokes my hair.&nbsp; I do not
believe a word they say about her being proud.&nbsp; I am sure
she is gentle.&nbsp; At least, her dream-hand on my head is
so.</p>

<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right">October 24th.</p>
<p><i>Dear old Carin</i>:</p>
<p>Mother McBirney has come.&nbsp; I have been alone with
her.&nbsp; Of course she had been told everything by Uncle David
on the way over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother-heart, mother-heart,&rdquo; I said to her,
&ldquo;tell me what I shall do.&nbsp; Here we are alone, we two,
and no one is listening.&nbsp; Whatever you decide on shall be
done.&nbsp; No matter what anyone says, we shall do
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Zalie,&rdquo; she said in that lovely drawling voice of
hers, &ldquo;I reckon the time has come for me and you to go our
separate ways.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother, do you know what I have been told?&nbsp; I am
rich.&nbsp; I shall have money to spend.&nbsp; All at once, in
one lump, right now, I can <a name="page48"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 48</span>have the money that would have been
mine all during the years since my father died.&nbsp; I have
asked them, and they say that though I am not of age, I may do
what I please with that money.&nbsp; So, mother-heart, you and
Father McBirney can go to the Springs, and Jim can go to
school.&nbsp; You can rent out the horses and the cattle or sell
them.&nbsp; Perhaps Annie Laurie will add them to her
stock.&nbsp; You can sell the chickens and the bees, or take them
to Annie Laurie&rsquo;s too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Zalie,&rdquo; cried Ma, &ldquo;how can you go on
talking about chickens and bees?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;sooner or later that is
what the three of you will sit up late at night talking
about.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m trying to arrange it so that you will not
say &lsquo;no.&rsquo;&nbsp; For I can&rsquo;t stand it to have
Father McBirney suffering the way he is, and you going sad and
poor and Jim not having school.&nbsp; I knew all the time that I
couldn&rsquo;t stand it&mdash;that I&rsquo;d have to do something
about it.&nbsp; And now here, along comes Accident&mdash;whom I
shall make my goddess&mdash;and she brings me among my own folk,
and gives me a fortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And parts us, Zalie.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>&ldquo;No, Mother McBirney.&nbsp; I say no!&nbsp; You
shall go to the Springs, you shall see Father get well.&nbsp; I
shall visit you from time to time.&nbsp; Then you will go back to
your own home, perhaps, and some day I shall build on that lovely
spot on the little bench, halfway up the mountain-side.&nbsp; You
remember that place with the three great tulip trees and the
spring of cold water?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll build me a little house
there, and all the mountain people and all the valley people
shall visit me.&nbsp; It will be near you, so that every time you
go to town you will be obliged to stop and have something to eat
and to get a drink at my spring.&nbsp; You shall not lose me, no,
no, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I gave her such a hug that she gasped.&nbsp; Though she is so
gentle I think she always rather liked my fierce ways.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you be living in that house alone, Zalie?&rdquo;
she asked me, looking just like Jim when he teases.&nbsp; And
though there wasn&rsquo;t a thing to make me blush&mdash;not one
thing&mdash;I got to blushing and couldn&rsquo;t stop.&nbsp; I
was perfectly furious with myself.&nbsp; How is it that sensible
people are sometimes so silly?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother McBirney,&rdquo; I said at last, &ldquo;is it <a
name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 50</span>nice of you
to peer into the future like that?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think
you are prying and&mdash;and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>She wouldn&rsquo;t let me finish.&nbsp; Anyway, I didn&rsquo;t
know <i>how</i> to finish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you do some of that kind of prying
yourself?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>Would you have thought Ma McBirney could have been so
naughty?</p>
<p>You will remember, Carin, that when your dear father and
mother asked me to live with them and be a sister to you, I
refused because I could not bring myself to leave Mother
McBirney.&nbsp; But then she was all sore and suffering from the
loss of her Molly; she had done the one wild and lawless thing of
her life in stealing me from the terrible people who claimed
me.&nbsp; I <i>had</i> to stay with her then.&nbsp; But now I am
a young woman.&nbsp; I must make my own way, and I must help the
McBirney family.&nbsp; Moreover, the people who now take me are
my kin.&nbsp; In going with them I do my duty to my own family,
to my grandmother; I can make amends to her for all my father
made her suffer.&nbsp; Do you not see how different it is?</p>
<p>I explained it all to Mother McBirney.&nbsp; She <a
name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 51</span>is
reconciled&mdash;very quiet and rather strange, but
reconciled.&nbsp; She will get happier as time goes on.&nbsp; Oh,
I mean to make her very happy.</p>
<p>It is interesting to see her and my uncle and aunt
together.&nbsp; My uncle and aunt are very grand people, Carin,
but they have no better manners than little Ma McBirney.&nbsp;
You and I always said she had the nicest manners in the
world.&nbsp; They begin and end with kindness, and gentleness and
thoughtfulness, and with it all, she is so self-respectful, as if
she felt it her duty to cherish her own soul and mind and body
because they were God&rsquo;s gift to her.</p>
<p>Did I tell you that Mrs. Babb, the moon-shiner&rsquo;s mother,
was over taking care of Father McBirney and Jim?&nbsp; That
fierce mother of wild sons!&nbsp; I remember describing her that
way to myself long ago.&nbsp; But you know how kind and nice she
can be.&nbsp; She always was an obliging neighbor, and so, for
the matter of that, were her sons.&nbsp; You have heard about the
time her son set Hi Kitchell&rsquo;s arm and was good to
Jim.&nbsp; That was when I was kidnapped, and the whole
countryside was searching for little Azalea.</p>
<p>The funniest thing happened to Uncle David <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>and Mother
McBirney when they were coming over here together.&nbsp; Uncle
David knew, of course, about my going into the little cabin and
warming myself before the fire and helping myself to soup, so he
was watching out for the place.&nbsp; And sure enough he came to
it, and he and Mother McBirney went in.&nbsp; There were two
women there, a mother and daughter, and both were very nice
looking, though one, of course, was no longer young.&nbsp; They
seemed different from most of the mountaineers; not inclined to
tell much about themselves.&nbsp; They showed the picture of me,
and they said they had enjoyed the things I left.&nbsp; They
talked about me quite a little, and were polite, though cold and
offish.&nbsp; Uncle David had his camera with him, and he wanted
to take pictures of them to bring to me, but they objected to
that.&nbsp; Wasn&rsquo;t that queer of them?&nbsp; Some day I am
going to call on them, unless indeed I leave this part of the
country forever and ever.&nbsp; I suppose I may.</p>
<p>Aunt Lorena doesn&rsquo;t want me to go to
Mallowbanks&mdash;that is the name of the old Knox
place&mdash;all in my homespun.&nbsp; She wants to dress me out
as Queen Guinevere did Enid.&nbsp; <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>I have asked her to wait, but she is
not very well content to do so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you are presented to your grandmother in
homespun,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;she will remember it to the
last day of her life.&nbsp; Your grandmother is very old, Azalea,
so that she is inclined to pay too much attention to little
matters.&nbsp; She will say to everyone who comes to the house:
&lsquo;This is Azalea, the daughter of my dear Jack.&nbsp; She
came to me in homespun, but I have clothed her in silk&mdash;as
becomes her.&rsquo;&nbsp; Oh, it is so easy to imagine her saying
it.&nbsp; Truly, she will never forget the homespun nor let you
forget it.&nbsp; What is worse, she will insist on dressing you
herself, and she will probably do it out of the cedar chests in
the lumber room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Out of the cedar chests?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the famous, terrible cedar chests.&nbsp; They are
filled with loot from all over the world&mdash;old shawls and
crepes and brocades and laces.&nbsp; Never was there such an
expensive and unusable mess.&nbsp; Ever since David married me
she has wanted me to make over these things&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And very lovely you would look in them,&rdquo; <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>broke in my
Uncle David in gentle rebuke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lovely, indeed,&rdquo; cried Aunt Lorena.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I would look like a romantic scarecrow.&nbsp; No, David,
the ladies who wore those gowns dressed in the fashion of their
day, and I mean to dress in the fashion of mine.&nbsp; I warn
Azalea right now that if she doesn&rsquo;t let me send to
Charleston for fit and proper clothing for her, she&rsquo;ll be
wearing those stiff old things to the day of
her&mdash;marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;d be certain to have my wedding dress made
out of the chests, I should think,&rdquo; I said, perfectly
delighted with the idea.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hasn&rsquo;t grandmother
saved her wedding dress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course she has, and her wedding chemise and slippers
and veil and fan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;just let me lie still and
think about it awhile.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t it like a fairy
tale?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I did.&nbsp; I lay still quite a while looking at the fire,
and wondering if it could be true that I, Azalea Knox, who had
believed myself to be little more than a waif, was coming into a
home all mellow and beautiful with old customs and memories and
loves&mdash;and hates, too, I suppose.&nbsp; Then I seemed to
feel that <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>something was wrong, and looking up I saw my new Uncle
David frowning at me&mdash;distinctly frowning.</p>
<p>So I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you frown, Uncle David?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you so interested in bridal dresses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t all girls interested in bridal
dresses?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not when they are infants like yourself,
miss.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am eighteen and over,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
you don&rsquo;t have daydreams when you are eighteen, when will
you have them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;True for you, Azalea,&rdquo; cried my aunt with her
high laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pay no attention to him.&nbsp; I was
just turned seventeen when we became engaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The circumstances were peculiar,&rdquo; said my uncle,
rather red in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were,&rdquo; said my aunt.&nbsp; &ldquo;You wanted
me, and you were afraid I might&mdash;want someone
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we waited,&rdquo; said my uncle, &ldquo;a long,
long time.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>&ldquo;Two years and three months,&rdquo; said my
aunt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Few, however, would be justified in marrying so
young,&rdquo; said my uncle.&nbsp; &ldquo;But we were peculiarly
suited to each other.&nbsp; Both families approved.&nbsp; You, my
dear Azalea, have not been so situated as to see much of people
in your own station of life, so it will probably be many years
before you will have any occasion to ask my mother for her old
white satin wedding gown.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said nothing at all but just smiled at the fire.&nbsp; I
could feel Uncle David still watching me.&nbsp; At last he
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why are you smiling?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you still thinking of the wedding gown?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only vaguely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Azalea, have you any secret to tell us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;None.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could Mrs. McBirney throw any light on that peculiar
smile of yours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But would dear old Ma go back on me?&nbsp; You know she would
not.</p>
<p><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>&ldquo;Zalie is like my Jim,&rdquo; she drawled,
&ldquo;a good deal of a tease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I threw her a kiss.&nbsp; And Uncle David shook his fist at
me.</p>
<p>Ah, Carin, why are you not here?&nbsp; Why can we not slip in
bed side by side each night as we used up at Sunset Gap?&nbsp; I
have so many things to tell you, and I cannot begin to make them
clear merely writing them like this.&nbsp; Though I find I like
to write.&nbsp; I have been reading and reading for years and
thinking how hard it must be to write, and now, for the first
time, I am really trying my hand at it, and I find it about as
easy as breathing.&nbsp; Of course, writing to you, who
understand me and my ways so well, makes it particularly
easy.&nbsp; I do not say that I would dare to write for strangers
or that I would like to do it.&nbsp; And yet, I wonder, Carin, if
one were to write a book just as if one were talking to a friend,
showing all one&rsquo;s heart and counting on the readers to
understand and sympathize, if it would not be a good book.</p>
<p>A book has to be human to be good, doesn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp; And
writing that way, frankly, even lovingly, I may say, letting
people feel that you <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>who are writing are really a friend,
although unknown, would make a book human, wouldn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>I suppose there are a great many lonely folk in the world who
have not had the good fortune to make friends, or even to find
their own home, in any true and deep sense of the word, and that
to such, a friendly book is a great boon.&nbsp; It is something
to take down off the shelf at night in the quiet hours, and to
read over and over again.&nbsp; It helps them to forget their
troubles and even themselves, and they go to bed comforted and
warmed at the heart, remembering that the old world is a pretty
kind and genial place after all.</p>
<p>If I could write, it is such a book as that which I would
choose to make.&nbsp; And do you know, the last few days as I
have been lying here thinking and thinking, I&rsquo;ve wondered
if I might not write a little.&nbsp; It would do such pleasant
things to my life.&nbsp; It would be like planting little gardens
of flowers all about me.&nbsp; Haven&rsquo;t we a right to plant
flowers if we have a taste for them?&nbsp; Planting flowers and
writing, like everything else that one does, is largely a matter
of habit, don&rsquo;t you think so?</p>
<p><a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>To-morrow Mother McBirney is going home.&nbsp; Uncle
David is going to take her.&nbsp; She is to close up the house,
send Jim to school, and betake herself and Father McBirney to
Bethal Springs for the winter.&nbsp; Uncle David has written down
to engage a cosy little furnished cottage for them.&nbsp; He has
given me a check for them.&nbsp; I am very happy, Carin.</p>
<p>I told you I was going to make Accident my goddess.&nbsp; I
like Accident.&nbsp; Just turning around the corner may bring one
face to face with&mdash;with something glorious.&nbsp; I feel all
the time now as if something delightful and surprising were going
to happen.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Lovingly</i>,</p>

<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;Little Windows,&rdquo; Oct.
29.</p>
<p>Carin, we are off.&nbsp; The &ldquo;little windows&rdquo; are
all boarded up.&nbsp; The servants have been driven to the
station.&nbsp; Outside the door the touring car is standing,
silent but eager.&nbsp; I swear it looks eager, and that I am
horribly afraid of it.&nbsp; I expect to have a chill.&nbsp; My
teeth chatter at this moment at the thought of <a
name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 60</span>riding in
that long, raging, rushing thing around these winding mountain
roads.&nbsp; I feel as if this might be the last letter I shall
ever write to you.&nbsp; I said I loved Accident, but that
depends on how she looks.&nbsp; To-day I do not like the looks of
her.&nbsp; I cut her acquaintance.&nbsp; If you never hear from
me again, remember how I loved you.</p>
<p>Aunt Lorena and Uncle David are putting the last touches to
things, and I am sitting on the porch scribbling in my
notebook.&nbsp; From here we can see thirty peaks and many
valleys and rivers.&nbsp; The rivers are silver threads in the
purple distance, winding and winding.&nbsp; There is an eagle
just above the house, probably come to see that we get safely
away.&nbsp; I wish he would teach me how to fly so that I
wouldn&rsquo;t have to ride in that terrible machine.</p>
<p>The only thing that cheers me up is the thought that I am
really going home.&nbsp; After so many homeless years, or years
in which I had a home only by the kindness of others, I am going
to my own home, to my own grandmother, blood of my blood, the
mother of my father.</p>
<p>Do you suppose those who love us and are <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>dead, know
what is happening to us?&nbsp; Is my own little mother seeing me
this day?&nbsp; Is she glad I am going to the home which never
opened its doors to her?&nbsp; Am I loyal to her in going?&nbsp;
These questions are too hard for me to answer.&nbsp; I only know
that my uncle and aunt would be shocked and deeply offended if I
did not go with them, and I remember that to the last my mother
loved my father.</p>
<p>When she lay dead that day in dear Mother McBirney&rsquo;s
house, they found in the leather pocket book she carried, a
little piece of dark hair which must have been his, with her
&ldquo;wedding lines,&rdquo; as Mother McBirney called them, and
a little blurred picture which was, no doubt, of him.&nbsp; But
her tears or the rain had dimmed it so we could barely see
it.</p>
<p>Your letter was brought me last night, Carin, and was the
greatest sort of a comfort.&nbsp; Oh, I knew you would
understand.</p>
<p>Aren&rsquo;t you taking too many studies?&nbsp; You
mustn&rsquo;t wear yourself out.&nbsp; Never forget that you are
going to be an artist and that you have to consider your talent
above everything else.&nbsp; So be careful not to use yourself up
on mathematics and physics and all those things.</p>
<p><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>I am
glad you are having some good times.&nbsp; That young man who
sent you flowers is a Southerner, is he?&nbsp; From
Charleston?&nbsp; Why didn&rsquo;t you tell me his name?&nbsp;
Perhaps I shall be meeting him.&nbsp; For I am to meet
people.&nbsp; I mean, I am to meet them the way you do.&nbsp;
Aunt Lorena will give a &ldquo;coming out&rdquo; party for
me.&nbsp; It rather amuses me.&nbsp; Poor Azalea, with her boots
covered with red mud and her hands scratched with briars and
burned with cooking and pricked with sewing, and her hair tumbled
every which way, Azalea who can whistle through her fingers as
well as Jim or Hi or any of the boys, who can climb a fence in a
jiffy and shin up a tree if necessary, to stand all perfumed and
proper, in a wonderful old drawing-room, saying: &ldquo;Thank
you, madam, you are very good to say so.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Thank you, sir, indeed I am very much honored to meet my
grandmother&rsquo;s old friends.&rdquo;&nbsp; Can you hear
me?&nbsp; I wish you could in reality.&nbsp; Perhaps I can get my
aunt to put off the party till Thanksgiving.&nbsp; If so, could
you dash down to Mallowbanks?&nbsp; It is not far from
Charleston.&nbsp; You could take a few extra days from college,
couldn&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>The
very thought of it puts new courage into me.&nbsp; You will find
my new address within.&nbsp; Write me at once.&nbsp; I shall
insist that Annie Laurie come to my party also.&nbsp; What a
reunion that would be!&nbsp; To have the old friends and the new
together would be something to remember always.</p>
<p>Maybe the young-man-who-sent-the-roses will be home for
Thanksgiving.&nbsp; Then he could come too, and I would see if he
was nice enough to&mdash;to be allowed to send you roses.</p>
<p>Do you suppose Keefe could come?&nbsp; But he wouldn&rsquo;t,
would he?&nbsp; At least, not unless I got an order for him to
paint a portrait.&nbsp; And how could I do that?&nbsp; But maybe
I can insist that he shall paint a portrait of my grandmother for
me.&nbsp; My own grandmother!</p>
<p>There, Uncle David is cranking that terrible machine.&nbsp; I
must go.&nbsp; Carin, we who go to die salute thee!</p>
<p>I will you my amber beads.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">MADAM GRANDMOTHER</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: right">Mallowbanks, Brent County, S. C.,<br
/>
November first.</p>
<p><i>Poor neglected Carin</i>:</p>
<p>I know it, Carin.&nbsp; I know I have treated you badly.&nbsp;
I know that you have been expecting and wondering and scolding
because I have not written.</p>
<p>But when you say that I have forgotten you because of my new
friends, well&mdash;I haven&rsquo;t any answer to that.&nbsp;
Nothing pleasant ever happens to me that I do not wish you were
with me to share it, and nothing bad ever happens that I do not
think in the midst of all my trouble:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will make a story out of that to tell to Carin
and&mdash;well, Annie Laurie or any other person whom I
love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But you first, Carin.</p>
<p>As you may have guessed, we got here alive.&nbsp; <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>I was really
very much surprised.&nbsp; Between shivers and shudders I enjoyed
the ride tremendously.&nbsp; We had two days and a half of it,
sleeping at night in inns where my uncle and aunt were welcomed
very warmly, and where everybody marveled over me very much as
they did in the old days when Mother McBirney first took me over
and carried me with her everywhere to exhibit me so lovingly and
triumphantly.</p>
<p>Only this time there were differences; very great
differences.&nbsp; I soon realized that to be the daughter of the
house of Knox was no small matter, and though I had insisted on
keeping to my homespun, and still do think it very nice, I was a
trifle worried about it.&nbsp; But my riding suit is well cut,
and it fits like a dream, and the homespun is almost as soft as
camel&rsquo;s hair, and the color of it, a bottle green, becomes
me very well.&nbsp; I was wearing the little dark green Alpine
hat you brought me from Switzerland, and that was becoming
too.</p>
<p>Yet, girl-o&rsquo;-my-heart, I felt frightened and
insignificant enough when, having passed by way of many charming
old towns and wide plantations, we came at last to the long,
shady <a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 66</span>road
which they told me belonged to the Knox estate.&nbsp; The part we
passed through was all in fine old trees, not so near together
but that the sun could make bright carpets in between them.&nbsp;
Here and there, where the ground lifted, we could see the
plantations, now of course in their autumn bareness, stretching
in three directions.</p>
<p>I have always loved to read about princes and princesses who
have wandered, poor and forlorn, in strange lands, and who
finally return to their royal homes and live happy ever after
amid a loving people.&nbsp; I think that is the nicest sort of a
story in the world, and I often have played, when it was cold and
windy in my little loft on Tennyson Mountain, and when Jim teased
me, and all the family was looking at something in a different
way from what I was able to do, that I was a lost princess and
that by and by I would come into my own.</p>
<p>But I never really thought it anything but a silly, silly
dream.&nbsp; I played with it as I used, a few years before, to
play with paper dolls.</p>
<p>Yet here I was, Carin, being swept up to the door of my
ancestral mansion.&nbsp; We turned a bend in the road, and then
saw the house across a stretch of lawn.&nbsp; It was all <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>dripping with
Virginia creeper; the leaves hung red as flame from the hooded
windows, and bannerets of the scarlet vine fluttered from the
wide door.&nbsp; Did uncle tell me the house was Georgian in its
style?&nbsp; I do not remember.&nbsp; At any rate, it is of
old-rose brick and &ldquo;I am glad, mother,&rdquo; said, as
mellow as a soft sunset.&nbsp; There are six hooded windows and
the beautiful door down below, and seven windows above; then at
each end of the main part of the building is an L, running
obliquely out into the lawn, and here, too, are the hooded
windows above, but below are galleries, and they are roofed in
some places and uncovered in others, so that you can stay under
cover if you like, or right out under the stars.</p>
<p>I found myself clasping my hands tight over my heart as I
looked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like it, dear?&rdquo; asked Aunt Lorena
gently.</p>
<p>I seized her hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Aunt Lorena, did you come here a bride?&nbsp; Did
Uncle David bring you here?&nbsp; Had you ever seen it
before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had known it ever since I was a child, but
notwithstanding that, the day I entered it <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>and knew it
for my own to live in was one of the happiest of my
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All on account of the house, I suppose,&rdquo; growled
Uncle David from the front seat of the car.&nbsp; Aunt Lorena
laughed like a bird and said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the years must have rolled sweetly by,
Lorena,&rdquo; said I under my breath.</p>
<p>She smiled at me beautifully, and then we got out of the car,
and there were people running from out of the house and from
around the house to help us&mdash;kind, affectionate, capable
black people, happy and well placed.</p>
<p>They all looked at me, open-eyed, like children, and they
bowed and smiled, but all the time I could see they were
wondering.&nbsp; Then Uncle David took me by the hand and led me
up the steps and turned with me and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is Miss Azalea Knox, the daughter of my brother
John.&nbsp; She has come here to be the daughter of the house and
your young mistress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the old days&mdash;or at least in story books&mdash;my
&ldquo;faithful retainers&rdquo; would have cheered.&nbsp; These
did not cheer, but there were murmurs of interest and pleasure,
and then they began <a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>coming up to wish me happiness with the sweetest manners
imaginable.&nbsp; So I shook hands with them all, and liked them,
and felt I would enjoy doing things for them and that I could ask
them to do things for me.&nbsp; All the while, inside, deep down,
there was a curious chuckling going on in me.&nbsp; I
couldn&rsquo;t help having that laugh with myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the poor homespun princess really has come to her
ancestral halls,&rdquo; I kept thinking.&nbsp; I wondered that it
didn&rsquo;t strike Uncle David and Aunt Lorena and that they
didn&rsquo;t laugh.&nbsp; But no, Carin, they were quite serious
and grand, and I soon saw how well their stately ways went with
that beautiful place.</p>
<p>I mustn&rsquo;t take time to describe all the place to you,
must I?&nbsp; But I cannot pass on without telling you my first
impression of the great hall by which we entered.&nbsp; There was
a high paneling in carved wood, and a sweeping staircase, with
carved panels, and a fireplace, all beautifully carved too.&nbsp;
The dark, shining floor was covered with strips of gray
carpeting, and at the doors and the great window of leaded glass
on the landing were silvery curtains with bands of white and
black.&nbsp; Then there was the clock <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>of teakwood, and a lovely statue of a
Diana in pinky-white marble, so delicate the light came through
her arm.</p>
<p>An unusual room, you must admit that.&nbsp; To the returning
princess, who has seen no grandeur save that to be found in your
beautiful home, Carin, it was rather&mdash;well, rather
overpowering.</p>
<p>Mother McBirney had sent my clothes to me, of course, and now
my little bag was taken up to my room, and I was told to follow
Mary Greenville Female Seminary Simms&mdash;Semmy for
short&mdash;the old benevolent-faced colored woman.</p>
<p>We went up the wonderful stairway, I saying nothing and
breathing pretty hard, but trying not to let anyone know it, and
then along the upper hallway to a shuttered door.&nbsp; It was
opened for me and I went in to what was to be my room.</p>
<p>So quaint, so complete was it, Carin, that I hardly know how
to describe it to you.&nbsp; The walls were papered with a design
of pine leaves on pearly white; the draperies were white muslin
and green silk; the furniture was of white wood, upholstered in
green.&nbsp; There were <a name="page71"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 71</span>only two pictures, both of the sea;
one with wild waves dashing over a rock in the bright sunshine,
the other a quiet, wonderful picture of rippling miles of water
the color of the inside of a shell.&nbsp; The sun must have been
rising, but one did not see it&mdash;only banks of soft cloud,
with a gray veil before them.</p>
<p>Can you imagine it all?</p>
<p>Then, as each drawer was opened, or the closets, or the
armoire, sweet odors of dried herbs came forth.&nbsp; Everywhere
was fragrance and peace.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You-all trunks will be comin&rsquo; along by express I
reckon,&rdquo; said Semmy as she began to unpack my bag.&nbsp; I
wondered what Aunt Lorena would wish me to say.&nbsp; Should I
let my black maid know that all I owned was there before
her&mdash;not enough to fill two of the drawers in the deep
bureau?&nbsp; Then it occurred to me that it was not necessary to
tell her anything at all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How nicely you have put everything away,&rdquo; I said
to her.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here is a little basket that I made with my
own hands.&nbsp; Will you let me give it to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I got rid of Semmy and her questions, and <a
name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>was left
alone wondering what I should do next.&nbsp; Nothing I possessed
went in any way with my grand surroundings, but I reflected that
Mother McBirney would have decided, in such circumstances, that
one could at least be neat and clean.</p>
<p>So I bathed in my beautiful bathroom, and I donned fresh
clothes.&nbsp; It was rather chilly, and I hardly knew what to
wear.&nbsp; But at last I put on the low-necked white frock Aunt
Zillah Pace made for me&mdash;every stitch hand sewn&mdash;and
the amber beads your mother gave me, and a scarf of yellow silk
that was Barbara Summers&rsquo; Christmas present to me.&nbsp; I
had some white slippers and silk stockings&mdash;gifts from your
dear mother, Carin.&nbsp; So I managed fairly well, I
thought.</p>
<p>Out in the corridor I met my aunt coming to my room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have told your grandmother,&rdquo; she
whispered.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is terribly excited.&nbsp; I ought to
have waited, perhaps&mdash;to let her get acquainted with you and
then to tell her after she became fond of you.&nbsp; Oh, I wish I
had!&nbsp; But it is too late now.&nbsp; Anyway, we mustn&rsquo;t
keep her waiting a minute.&nbsp; How lovely you <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>look,
Azalea!&nbsp; Just as a young girl should.&nbsp; Will you come
with me now?&nbsp; Your uncle is with his mother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had never seen Aunt Lorena excited before, and I could
hardly understand why she should be so now, though I will confess
that I felt very strange myself.&nbsp; I had to take hold of Aunt
Lorena&rsquo;s arm going down that long flight of stairs.</p>
<p>Then, once we were down, the old black butler bowed us into
the drawing-room, which was glittering with old-time luster
candelabra, and at the end of the room, all in gray and white and
diamonds, with hair of pure silver, was the littlest, proudest,
stateliest lady I ever saw or dreamed of.&nbsp; You cannot
imagine how small she was or how regal.&nbsp; She sat in a
high-backed carved chair on a dais, like a queen, and Uncle David
stood by her quite as if he were her prime minister and were
terribly worried over some affair of state.</p>
<p>I saw him looking at me anxiously, and I knew he was doubting
my power to please this little queenly lady.&nbsp; But at that
very moment all of my own fears departed and I only remembered
that at last here was one of my very, very <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>own folk, and
I ran down the room and lifted her hand in mine and kissed
it.&nbsp; Yes, I knelt right there on that queer little dais and
held her hand to my lips.&nbsp; I was going to call her
&ldquo;grandmother,&rdquo; but she looked so regal that I could
not quite speak that familiarly, so I called her &ldquo;madam
grandmother&rdquo; instead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam grandmother,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;I am your own
granddaughter.&nbsp; Please, please love me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arise, my child,&rdquo; she said as if I were indeed
the long lost daughter of a queen&mdash;as I so often had
pretended to be&mdash;and she lifted me up and looked at me
through her little gold-rimmed lorgnette.</p>
<p>&ldquo;David,&rdquo; she said proudly, &ldquo;she is the
living image of our dear Jack!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, mother,&rdquo; said Uncle David gently.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was sure you would think that, and indeed I agree with
you, and so does Lorena.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lorena,&rdquo; said madam grandmother in a voice of
command, &ldquo;I confide this child to your keeping.&nbsp; She
must be your especial care.&nbsp; You will rear her, Lorena, to
be worthy of her name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad, mother,&rdquo; said Aunt Lorena, <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>&ldquo;that
you think me capable of performing such an important and delicate
task.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lorena, you were a Ravanel, and the Ravanels have no
need to doubt themselves.&nbsp; I could place her in no better
hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Aunt Lorena has already been looking after me more
kindly than I can say, madam grandmother,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I cannot tell you how good she was to me when I was
ill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hah!&rdquo; cried my grandmother, &ldquo;I like your
voice, Azalea.&nbsp; Moreover, I like your manner; and I admire
your name.&nbsp; I wish to hear something of your life.&nbsp;
David and Lorena, you have, no doubt, already heard this
story.&nbsp; If you wish to withdraw you may do so.&nbsp; Please
close the doors as you go.&nbsp; My granddaughter and myself will
have a conference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carin, would you have supposed anyone could speak in this
manner in the present day and generation?&nbsp; I would never
have believed it myself if I had not heard it.</p>
<p>Sampson, the old butler, was summoned to bring up a low,
comfortable chair for me, and sitting in this, holding my
grandmother&rsquo;s little wrinkled, jeweled hands in mine, I
told her all the story.</p>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>Once
she asked me to ring to have the fire lighted in the great
fireplace, and &ldquo;old James,&rdquo; as the utility man is
called, came in and did it.&nbsp; Otherwise we were left quite to
ourselves.&nbsp; Callers came, but she asked to be excused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have been receiving callers all my life,&rdquo; she
said to me, &ldquo;but never, never before have I sat with a
granddaughter of my own&mdash;and as true a Knox as ever drew the
breath of life.&nbsp; Every tone of your voice, my dear, reminds
me of your father; every look and gesture is like him.&nbsp; This
is the happiest day I have had for many years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not question my identity at all, madam
grandmother,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is very gracious of
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The story your Uncle David told me was convincing, my
child.&nbsp; But aside from that, your face is a confirmation of
the truth of your story.&nbsp; But continue, please.&nbsp; I wish
to hear everything you have to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I talked on and on, and she listened seriously and kindly,
sometimes with her head drooping a little, other times proudly,
with her little gold-bound glasses raised.&nbsp; I could see that
she suffered horribly when I told of <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>how my sweet mother and I had
struggled on, how we had gone hungry and cold and had had to
associate with drunken, coarse, cruel people.&nbsp; But I told
her everything.&nbsp; I seemed to owe that much to my little
mother.</p>
<p>Then, after a long time, I finished.&nbsp; She looked at me
with a strange, sad, wistful air that made me, for all her pride,
think of a child who had done wrong and who wished to be
forgiven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you did not
know your father, Azalea.&nbsp; You would have loved him.&nbsp;
No one could help loving him.&nbsp; Please, for my sake, do not
hate his memory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I will not hate him,
or anyone.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t time to hate anyone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then a beautiful sound stole through the room.&nbsp; I
could not tell what it was or where it came from, but grandmother
smiled at my surprise and told me that it was only the dinner
gong.&nbsp; So she arose and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your arm, Azalea, please,&rdquo; and we went down the
long drawing-room together, and when we reached the door the old
butler threw wide the leaves of it for us, and we crossed the
great corridor and went to the dining room.&nbsp; <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>It was all
glittering with silver and glass and shining with white linen and
glowing with flowers, and there was the butler and a man to help
him, and Martha, grandmother&rsquo;s own woman, to stand behind
her chair.</p>
<p>Try to think of your own rough and ready Azalea, sitting there
amid that grandeur, acting as if she were used to it.&nbsp; But
it is asking too much of you, isn&rsquo;t it, honey?&nbsp;
Everyone talked very softly, and when they laughed they seemed to
do so rather cautiously, and the servants moved about as if it
would be a terrible crime to make a noise, though I could see
perfectly well by the expression of their faces, that they took
an interest in everything.&nbsp; Of course we had delicious
things to eat.&nbsp; There was some kind of a frozen dessert that
Aunt Lorena said was made in my honor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have this only on notable occasions,&rdquo; she
declared.</p>
<p>After dinner we went back to the drawing-room again, and my
grandmother asked me to sing.&nbsp; So I did, but not very well,
and she asked me to dance, and I did that, too, with Aunt Lorena
playing for me.&nbsp; But I don&rsquo;t believe I danced very
well either.&nbsp; Making <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>up a solo dance as you go along
isn&rsquo;t easy, is it, Carin?&nbsp; But at any rate,
grandmother seemed pleased, and I am sure it helped her to pass
the evening.&nbsp; The last hour I sat beside her, telling her
stories of Mother McBirney and all my friends, and she kept her
hand on my arm, and now and then cried to Uncle David:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it incredible that we have found her?&nbsp;
Isn&rsquo;t she the picture of your brother Jack?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Finally Aunt Lorena said it was time for us all to go to bed,
and when grandmother protested, she reminded her how weary we
were from our long journey.&nbsp; So old Martha was called for
grandmother, and Semmy was called for me, and we all went off to
our rooms.&nbsp; I had to laugh a little&mdash;at least, I think
I laughed, but maybe I cried, too&mdash;to think of my little
loft at home, and the pieces of round tin nailed over the mouse
holes.&nbsp; And then to look around at this new room of
mine!</p>
<p>The bed was soft as down, and scented with lavender, and there
was an eiderdown comfort to snuggle under.&nbsp; It was such a
wonderful bed that I couldn&rsquo;t go to sleep for thinking
about it, but lay awake for a long time, as I never had done in
my little loft.&nbsp; There was <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>much to think over, Carin&mdash;so
much.&nbsp; And always I kept wondering: &ldquo;Have I done
right?&nbsp; Is this going to help me weave my silver
web?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was so wrapped up in my thoughts that I heard, without
hearing, a certain little soft, stealthy sound for several
seconds before I realized that something unusual was
happening.&nbsp; Then, when that fact really came to me, I sat up
in bed to listen.</p>
<p>Someone, it was evident, was stealing along the hall.&nbsp;
Then I heard the soft, creeping steps down the stairs, and after
a while a door opened&mdash;a little door right beneath my
window.</p>
<p>I slipped out of bed and looked from my window, and I could
see a little white figure gliding away from the house.&nbsp; It
was no larger than that of a child, but the motions it made were
not a child&rsquo;s, and that is how I came to know that it was
grandmother.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t think it right for her to be
going out into the garden in the middle of the night in her night
clothes, so I ran down the stairs.&nbsp; I found the little door
opened from a cloak room, and I stumbled out into the darkness
after her.&nbsp; But <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>it was very dark and I did not know
the garden, so in a few moments I found myself quite hopelessly
lost amid the hedges.&nbsp; I was afraid something dreadful might
happen if I wasted any more time, so I got back to the house, and
ran upstairs to try to find Aunt Lorena&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>But all of the bedroom doors in the house have shutters to
them, and these shutters were closed, so I could not possibly
tell which rooms were occupied and which were not, and all I
could do was to run up and down, knocking at each one and
calling:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Aunt Lorena, Uncle David, come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was like a horrible nightmare.&nbsp; It seemed as if more
doors kept coming into existence right there before my
eyes.&nbsp; The place was so dark&mdash;I had no idea where to
find the electric buttons&mdash;that if the doors had not been
white I could not have seen them at all.&nbsp; Truly, Carin, it
was the most frightening thing that ever happened to me.</p>
<p>But I hear the dinner gong.&nbsp; I will send this off, there
is so much of it, and to-morrow I will write you again.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">MALLOWBANKS</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: right">Mallowbanks, November third.</p>
<p><i>Carin</i>, <i>dear</i>:</p>
<p>Where did I leave off?&nbsp; Oh, yes, where I went running
down the big dark, winding corridors, knocking and knocking at
the strange doors!</p>
<p>Well, presently one of them, far away from where I was,
opened, and a voice called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&nbsp; Oh, what is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it you, Aunt Lorena,&rdquo; I cried, running toward
the voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, Azalea.&nbsp; Tell me what is the
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandmother has gone out in the garden in her night
clothes.&nbsp; I tried to follow her, but I&rsquo;ve lost her
somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear,&rdquo; sighed my aunt.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is her
old trouble again.&nbsp; I suppose your coming excited her.&nbsp;
She has little spells of forgetfulness and <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>she wanders
out to meet Jack, your father, secretly, forgetting that he is
dead.&nbsp; After his father forbade him the house, she used to
do that&mdash;to meet him at night and take him money and
clothes&mdash;anything that she thought would help him.&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t believe she&rsquo;ll come to any harm.&nbsp; She
never has.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll send old Martha for her, for it
would hurt her feelings dreadfully if we were to go and if she
were to realize that she has been wandering again.&nbsp;
She&rsquo;s very proud, you know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, Oh, didn&rsquo;t I know it, Carin!&nbsp; Never have I
seen so much pride in such a little creature.</p>
<p>Aunt Lorena called old Martha, and the poor black thing, with
her huge nightcap on, and a great flowered robe, and slippers
that flopped at every step, ran sleepily out into the garden,
calling:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ole Miss, ole Miss, where be ye?&nbsp; Cain&rsquo;t ye
answer Martha?&nbsp; She&rsquo;s wanting ye bad!&nbsp; Please,
ole Miss, where be ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Lorena and I followed along behind, running down a long
shaded walk which the moonlight mottled, till at last we came to
a little pool.&nbsp; This was like a shield of bright <a
name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 84</span>steel, all
shining and wonderful.&nbsp; There were rustling noises all about
us which suited the place and the hour but which I did not
understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; I whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The swans.&nbsp; We have disturbed them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And just then, Carin, out into that glistening pool swam a
coal black swan followed by two white ones.&nbsp; They
didn&rsquo;t seem like real birds but like some sort of a
vision.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is just beyond the pond that mother used to go to
meet your father,&rdquo; said Aunt Lorena tenderly.&nbsp; I loved
her for speaking like that.&nbsp; She was sorry for this old
mother&rsquo;s grief, and sympathized with the memories that
haunted her and drove her from her bed.&nbsp; I put my arm right
around her neck and kissed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Aunt Lorena,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I think you are
very sweet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; she warned, and turning I saw Martha
coming back with her arm around poor little madam
grandmother.&nbsp; We stepped back in the shrubbery and kept very
still while they passed.&nbsp; Grandmother was weeping like a

85</span>&ldquo;Your young master wasn&rsquo;t there,
Martha,&rdquo; she was saying.&nbsp; &ldquo;He was to meet me
there to-night and I was to give him this.&rdquo;&nbsp; She held
up something in her hand that sparkled in the moonlight.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It was my own, Martha,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;so I had
a perfect right to give it away if I wanted.&nbsp; Oh, what do
you suppose has happened to your young master?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jes&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; at all, ole Miss,&rdquo;
Martha said, her voice sounding more like that of a wild dove
than anything else I could think of.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s sure
all right, ole Miss.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s jes&rsquo; doin&rsquo;
fine.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s why he didn&rsquo;t need for to come for
yo&rsquo; pretties.&nbsp; Yo&rsquo; jes&rsquo; take heart, ole
Miss.&nbsp; That Mass&rsquo; Jack, he won&rsquo;t let no hahm
come to him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pray heaven,&rdquo; Aunt Lorena whispered to me when
they had passed, &ldquo;that good old Martha will outlive mother,
for I have no idea how we should manage without her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We stole softly into the house and up a little flight of
stairs, and then down the corridor to grandmother&rsquo;s
door.&nbsp; We could hear Martha still crooning to her as if she
were a frightened child, and then, little by little, grandmother
ceased weeping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; whispered Aunt Lorena, and we <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>stole away to
my room.&nbsp; She saw me back into my bed, and kissed me good
night&mdash;not warmly, the way Mother McBirney used, but gently
and kindly.&nbsp; I like her better for not pretending to what
she does not feel.&nbsp; She will grow fonder of me if I deserve
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll say nothing about this to your Uncle
David,&rdquo; she cautioned me.&nbsp; &ldquo;It makes him
wretched for days when he learns that his mother has been
&lsquo;wandering.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll not be ill as a result of this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably not&mdash;only a little distrait and
quiet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was left alone again in my fragrant room, and still I could
not sleep for thinking of how my life had changed, and how
curious were these people I had come among.&nbsp; I saw the stars
moving along in their courses, and light beginning to break in
the east.&nbsp; And then, just to show how inconsistent I could
be, I fell asleep.</p>
<p>I slept till noon.&nbsp; Think of it&mdash;me, the Early
Riser!</p>
<p>Perhaps I wouldn&rsquo;t have awakened then if Semmy
hadn&rsquo;t come in with chocolate and rolls and an omelet.</p>
<p><a name="page87"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
87</span>&ldquo;Ole Miss is wanting you, Miss,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>So I ate quickly and dressed in my dark blue frock with the
crocheted lace collar and cuffs and was taken to her.&nbsp; She
was in her bedroom still, or rather in her sitting room, for her
bedroom is a stately alcove raised two or three feet above her
sitting room.&nbsp; To-day she was all in purple, with studs of
amethysts in her white lace chemisette and at the fastenings of
her long lace sleeves.&nbsp; It was very difficult to imagine
that this was the same little broken creature I had heard weeping
aloud the night before, and being comforted like a baby.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; she said when I went in, &ldquo;I hear
that you did not rest well last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not very well, thank you, madam grandmother,&rdquo; I
said dropping her a curtsy as Aunt Lorena had told me to do.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Being in a new place no doubt disturbed you,&rdquo;
said my grandmother.&nbsp; &ldquo;You did well to refresh
yourself with sleep this morning.&nbsp; At your age, my dear, I
seldom arose before noon, but that was because of the many
gayeties in which I participated&mdash;a ball or a rout almost
every night, and gentlemen riding out in the afternoon to
call.&nbsp; The times are not so <a name="page88"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 88</span>brilliant now, I regret to say.&nbsp;
However, a few of the old families remain to keep alive the
elegant traditions of my time, and I have called you here,
Azalea, to say that I wish you to be presented to my
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I curtsied again.&nbsp; Her queer quaint way of talking made
me feel that nothing save a curtsy would suit the occasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, madam grandmother; I shall be
honored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My grandmother put up her lorgnette.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Azalea!&rdquo; she said sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, grandmother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your manners are admirable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, dear grandmother.&nbsp; I dare say they
are&mdash;are inherited.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My grandmother smiled and traced her left eyebrow with her
jeweled fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may sit down near me,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I want to talk to you about your coming-out
party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So then she told me something about her friends; who had done
this and who that, and every one she mentioned was at least sixty
years of age and some, as nearly as I could reckon, were eighty
or over.&nbsp; So at last I said:</p>
<p><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>&ldquo;And may I also be permitted to invite some of my
own friends, dear grandmother?&nbsp; Carin Carson who is now in
the North at college, and Annie Laurie Pace, who lives at Lee,
and Mr. and Mrs. Rowantree of Rowantree Hall, and their brother,
Keefe O&rsquo;Connor who is at the Academy of Design in New
York?&nbsp; And of course the McBirneys and the Summers,
and&mdash;and some others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t help thinking how I would like to have
Haystack Thompson play at my party, and how horrified grandmother
would be if she knew my thought and what Haystack is like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure,&rdquo; said my grandmother, &ldquo;that
these friends of yours would find congenial surroundings at
Mallowbanks, my dear Azalea?&nbsp; There is such a thing as
propriety to be considered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would it be proper for me to neglect the friends who
were faithful to me for years and years?&rdquo; I asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was an orphan and poor as a beggar, and they took me in
to sit beside their hearths.&nbsp; They gave me the best they
had; hospitality and love and learning.&nbsp; If I know anything
at all, it is owing to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said my grandmother, &ldquo;you
speak poetically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I speak the truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a loyal heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, madam grandmother, I admit it. When I once love, I
can never forget.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know? You are only a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be like you,&rdquo; I declared boldly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I wish to be like you and never to forget!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked at me sideways. Then she tilted her delicate chin
and faced me straight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Azalea&mdash;last night&mdash;did you know?&nbsp; Did
you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw, grandmother dear. Forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Azalea, your father was my dearest!&nbsp; They
almost killed me when they came between him and me.&nbsp; He was
wayward, I know, but he didn&rsquo;t have the same ideas of
goodness and badness that others have.&nbsp; I always loved
him.&nbsp; I love him still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is beautiful of you, madam grandmother.&nbsp; I hope
to be just like that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, Azalea.&nbsp; You shall have your friends to
your party if they will come.&nbsp; You shall ask the humblest if
you choose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, thank you, grandmother; you <a
name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 91</span>will be proud
to know them.&nbsp; The humblest of them are very sweet, but
some, I assure you, are not humble at all.&nbsp; They are
accomplished enough to win even your approval.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doubt they are charming, my dear
granddaughter.&nbsp; But you must remember that you have now come
into an important position.&nbsp; Much will be expected of
you.&nbsp; You will probably wed a Ravanel.&nbsp; Many of the
women of my family did.&nbsp; My son David did also, as you
know.&nbsp; It is a custom with us I may say.&nbsp; Yes, a
Ravanel or a Gr&eacute;vy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, dearest grandmother, I must marry the person I
love.&nbsp; What will his last name have to do with
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything, my dear child.&nbsp; Kindly fetch me yonder
book.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yonder book,&rdquo; Carin, was very much done up in an
embroidered cover and was lying on grandmother&rsquo;s far
cabinet.&nbsp; I wish you could see her cabinet of fans.&nbsp;
Some are quite historic and all are exquisite.</p>
<p>I brought the book and it proved to be a genealogy of the
Bryce family.&nbsp; (Bryce was grandmother&rsquo;s maiden
name.)&nbsp; We studied this for at least an hour, and then
grandmother <a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>called Martha to carry it to my room that I might have
it at hand to consult whenever I wished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will see,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that the Bryce
ladies have married Ravanels, Gr&eacute;vys or Knoxes from time
immemorial.&nbsp; You are a Knox.&nbsp; You will marry a Bryce, a
Ravanel or a Gr&eacute;vy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I tried not to laugh, but to save my life I couldn&rsquo;t
help it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps none of them will approve of me.&nbsp;
Remember, madam grandmother, I am only a homespun mountain
maid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but we will transform you into a shining
princess,&rdquo; cried my grandmother excitedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
already have had that matter in mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she clapped her jeweled old hands together as hard as she
could, and when Martha came running, gasping: &ldquo;Yessum, ole
Miss, yessum, ole Miss,&rdquo; grandmother said, like a potentate
in the Arabian Nights:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have the chests brought.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I remembered what Aunt Lorena had told me about the
chests in which grandmother kept her old treasures.&nbsp; So I
was to see these darling old brocades and crepes and <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>embroideries!&nbsp; Aunt Lorena thought it would be a
dreadful thing to have to dress in them, but I was wild to do
it.&nbsp; It seemed a part of all the strange play that my life
had become.</p>
<p>So presently two of the men servants came staggering in under
the weight of a great chest, and when they had set that down they
went back for another, and then for another yet.</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t have the chests opened till I had looked all
over the outside of them.&nbsp; One was covered with carmine
leather all tooled with gilt, and it had a great clasp with
cupids on it.&nbsp; Another was of dark carved wood, very heavy,
and lined with sandalwood that filled the whole room with an old,
dry perfume when it was opened.&nbsp; The other was a sea chest
with a sailor&rsquo;s name carved on it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Samuel Bings,&rsquo;&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What a funny name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My grandmother frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see nothing funny about it,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Samuel Bings was a very distinguished and unfortunate
man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I should love to hear his story some time,&rdquo; I
said contritely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall,&rdquo; said my grandmother relenting, <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>&ldquo;and
when I have told it to you, you will be proud that the name of
Bings appeared among your ancestry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, then, Carin, my little squirrel, we came to the opening
of the chests.&nbsp; How shall I ever describe to you what was in
them?&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t&mdash;not in one letter nor
three.</p>
<p>Shawls and dolmans, and great flounced skirts and lace
petticoats and silken nubias, and beaded fascinators, and real
lace and fans and slippers and silken stockings, and flowing
undersleeves, and old gloves and hats and feathers, and
embroidered lingerie and lace handkerchiefs and&mdash;Oh, mercy,
Carin, everything a belle of long ago would wear.&nbsp; And a
belle of to-day throw away.&nbsp; But, no, I must not be
disrespectful to old lace and brocade, nor to China crepe and
Irish poplin.</p>
<p>I tried on the old frocks and strutted and pranced around in
them, and put on the queer, short gloves which were as freckled
with mildew as Jim&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; Of course I don&rsquo;t
mean that Jim is mildewed.&nbsp; Only that he is freckled.</p>
<p>I wore the shawls, and dropped preposterous curtsies in the
flounced skirts, and I coquetted <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>with my own venerable grandmother
behind the cracked old fans, and did the plumes up in my
hair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said my grandmother at length,
&ldquo;you must have these interesting fabrics made over for
you.&nbsp; Some slight alteration will be necessary I suppose,
but on the whole they become you immensely.&nbsp; You look
completely a Bryce in them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Aunt Lorena came in.&nbsp; When she saw the litter
in that room and myself in a flowered silk seven yards around the
bottom of the skirt, and eighteen inches around the waist&mdash;I
was almost smothered by this time&mdash;she dropped in a chair
and turned white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At last!&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Lorena,&rdquo; said my grandmother with great
dignity.&nbsp; &ldquo;At last I have found someone who
appreciates these rare things.&nbsp; They were offered to you as
the wife of my only living son.&nbsp; You rejected them.&nbsp;
You preferred to wear inferior fabrics and passing styles.&nbsp;
But the styles in which these exquisite fabrics are made up, are
historic, Lorena, historic.&nbsp; This however, is a point which
you do not seem to appreciate.&nbsp; I therefore pass them on to
my <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>granddaughter&mdash;the daughter of my second son.&nbsp;
You will see that they are adapted to her needs, tightened
perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, dear grandmother,&rdquo; I cried struggling
with the hook of that terrible dress, that held me as if it were
made of steel, &ldquo;not tightened.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t say
tightened!&nbsp; I am suffocating!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Lorena came to my rescue and between us we got that band
undone and I was able to draw a long breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In my day,&rdquo; said my little grandmother,
&ldquo;girls were more delicate than they are now.&nbsp; I
grieve, Lorena, to discover that Azalea&rsquo;s foot is far too
substantial for these slippers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked regretfully at some yellowed satin slippers with
tarnished sequins on them.&nbsp; Aunt Lorena and I looked down at
my good sizable feet&mdash;they have done a powerful lot of
mountain climbing, as you know&mdash;and we both laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Aunt Lorena, &ldquo;we must forget
dressmaking for the day and go for a drive.&nbsp; You too,
mother.&nbsp; Won&rsquo;t you come in the motor just this
once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know very well that I will not, Lorena.&nbsp; My
pony cart will do for me.&nbsp; Have young <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>James walk at
the pony&rsquo;s head to-day, please.&nbsp; Old James ruined my
last drive by the way he groaned with the rheumatism.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So all the finery was carted off to a big empty room where, as
Aunt Lorena explained to grandmother, we would be able to look it
over better, and I was told to dress warmly, and so got into the
nice thick coat Mother McBirney had made for me, and put on my
mole-skin cap, and my veil and gloves&mdash;for Aunt Lorena is
terribly fussy about having people well wrapped when they go
motoring&mdash;and uncle and auntie and I went off.</p>
<p>We were gone for an hour or two and saw many beautiful old
estates, but none that I liked better than our own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mother is being drawn about the garden in the pony
cart,&rdquo; Aunt Lorena told me.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is curious, but
she never was a horsewoman.&nbsp; Even as a girl she was rather
timid with horses, and now she is very much afraid of them.&nbsp;
As for an automobile, it fills her with terror.&nbsp; So it seems
best to let her do the thing she enjoys, which is riding about
the garden and scolding the gardeners.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear!&rdquo; said Uncle David.</p>
<p><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 98</span>Aunt
Lorena lifted her eyebrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I didn&rsquo;t mean to say anything
disrespectful,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I was only
describing things as they are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That her description was quite right, we were soon to
see.&nbsp; Grandmother was still going about the garden when we
got home, and it was plain that she had &ldquo;everybody by the
ears.&rdquo;&nbsp; Young James was almost in tears, the head
gardener was sulky, the boys who helped him were laughing, and
every one was or pretended to be quite frightened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Young James,&rdquo; said my aunt, &ldquo;you have kept
Madam Knox out too long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yessum, I know it, mum.&nbsp; I wanted her to go in,
mum, but she wouldn&rsquo;t, mum.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, mum, mum, mum!&rdquo; snapped grandmother,
quivering with fatigue.&nbsp; &ldquo;Who ever heard such
talk?&nbsp; Mum, mum, mum!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uncle David said nothing.&nbsp; He got out of the motor and
gathered his little silver-headed mother up in his arms and
carried her into the house as if she were a baby.&nbsp; She put
her two arms around his neck and held on tight, and I saw him
kiss her very tenderly when he put her down and called Martha to
her.</p>
<p><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>&ldquo;Mum, mum,&rdquo; she began saying again, but
Uncle David said: &ldquo;Stop that, mother, please,&rdquo; and
she did.</p>
<p>So, Carin, this is the life at Mallowbanks.</p>
<p>My party is to be Thanksgiving Day.&nbsp; Say, Oh, say that
you can come!&nbsp; To have you here, to have you see all I am so
stupidly telling you about, to get off in my own room with you
and laugh and talk as we used, would, perhaps, make this life
seem real to me.&nbsp; Now, I confess, it seems like a dream.</p>
<p>You keep writing about that young Southerner.&nbsp; You say he
is leaving the North and going home.&nbsp; He lives in
Charleston?&nbsp; Is his name Bryce or Ravanel or
Gr&eacute;vy?&nbsp; If so, I&rsquo;ve got to marry him!</p>
<p>Aunt Lorena said, however, that the only unmarried Ravanel was
at least seventy and deaf as an adder, and that she
wouldn&rsquo;t, if she were in my place, be so hackneyed as to
marry a Gr&eacute;vy.&nbsp; As for the Bryces, they are my very
own kin and out of the question.&nbsp; So you can imagine my
distress!&nbsp; Tut, tut, no bridegroom.&nbsp; And me in long
dresses with my hair up.&nbsp; How long must I wait?</p>
<p>As long, perhaps, as my coming-out party.</p>
<p><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 100</span>But
it can&rsquo;t be any sweeter than the birthday party Ma McBirney
gave me when we danced till the moon came up&mdash;and after.</p>
<p>Carin, you <i>must</i> come!</p>

<span class="GutSmall">MY BALL</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: right">Mallowbanks, November thirtieth.</p>
<p><i>Bad</i>, <i>dear</i>, <i>bad Carin</i>:</p>
<p>You didn&rsquo;t come to my party!&nbsp; Oh, wretched, false
friend, best and most cherished, why did you not come?&nbsp; Can
it be that a mere desire to have higher marks than anyone else in
school caused you to desert me in my hour of triumph?&nbsp; It
was that, I know.&nbsp; You are trying to get that old Phi Beta
Kappa key&mdash;which you&rsquo;ll not wear after you <i>do</i>
get it.&nbsp; I call it intellectual pride, I do indeed.</p>
<p>Keefe couldn&rsquo;t come either.&nbsp; He had an order to do
a portrait for some Great Lady.&nbsp; So he wouldn&rsquo;t even
think of coming.&nbsp; He said he was in the Right Mood for Work,
and he expected me to tremble before those awful words, just as
you expected me to tremble before your Phi Beta Kappa
record.&nbsp; You two, doing your duty with all your might and <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>leaving me
alone in my frivolity!&nbsp; I call it shabby of you.</p>
<p>Well, anyway, Annie Laurie came and Barbara Summers with
her.&nbsp; Barbara put little Jonathan in the care of Aunt Zillah
Pace, and she kept saying that she felt perfectly all right about
him, though one could see that she didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; It was the
first time she ever had left him overnight, and so it was natural
for her to feel nervous.&nbsp; Though, as you know, Jonathan is
going to insist on being taken care of, and if there is anything
he wants he is going to have it.&nbsp; He is such a dear that no
one can refuse him anything, as I know to my cost!&nbsp; The
treasures of mine that child has broken!</p>
<p>Yes, those two came, and I leave you to imagine how happy it
made me.&nbsp; There was my little brown Barbara with her sweet
voice and her shy-eager eyes, all dressed so quaintly, and being
so desirous of pleasing everyone, and yet holding to her own
ideas with that darling dignity of hers; and there was my big,
glorious Annie Laurie Pace with her red hair and her definite
ways, trying to be frivolous with the rest of us, and looking
like a preoccupied Diana all the time.&nbsp; I had some fears <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>that when
the folk at Mallowbanks learned that what she really was
preoccupied with was her own dairy, that they might cast her into
the outer darkness where the vast company of
people-the-Knoxes-do-not-know drag out their miserable
lives.&nbsp; But no, the vast fields of Annie Laurie&mdash;they
did not lose a rod in my description of them&mdash;the cattle on
a thousand hills, more or less, and the well trained force of
helpers appealed to their imagination.&nbsp; They regarded her as
a Planter&mdash;or a Plantress.&nbsp; She was accepted.&nbsp; And
she was accepted all the more because she really and truly
didn&rsquo;t care much whether she was or not.&nbsp; Annie Laurie
came to Mallowbanks for the sole purpose of making me happy, and
she certainly succeeded.&nbsp; I put her in my room, and I slept
on a lounge in the dressing room.&nbsp; So we contrived to be
together, and of course, just like the girls in the song, we let
down our hair before the fire after the ball.</p>
<p>But I must come to the subject of the ball.</p>
<p>To begin with, Mallowbanks was full of guests who had come to
stay for two nights, or four, or seven, as the case might
be.&nbsp; They were kin or near-kin, or old neighbors who <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>were as
dear as kin, and they all called each other by their first
names.&nbsp; All the men, or nearly all, had military or judicial
titles; and the women were lovely and, in a way,
willful&mdash;because they had been much loved, I suppose.&nbsp;
From first to last it seemed to me like one of my old dreams and
nothing else.</p>
<p>My coming-out party was in several parts.</p>
<p>To begin with, there was the afternoon reception.&nbsp;
Ladies, mostly, came to that, though there were some men,
too.&nbsp; This was preceded by a luncheon for forty.&nbsp;
(There were little tables scattered all over the drawing-room, as
well as the dining room.)&nbsp; The next day there was a
ball.&nbsp; That was the culmination.&nbsp; And all week there
have been rides and drives and dinners and breakfasts and
teas.&nbsp; I have met hundreds of people.&nbsp; I like them
all.&nbsp; I love none, save the people here in my own house, and
Annie Laurie and my little Barbara.&nbsp; I met Ravanels and
Gr&eacute;vys and Bryces, but one and all neglected to ask my
hand in marriage.&nbsp; There was, indeed, only one I would think
of marrying, and, Oh, you yellow-headed little Hun, I had not
talked with him three minutes before I knew that he was your
Southerner.</p>
<p><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>&ldquo;I have a great many messages for you from your
friend Miss Carson,&rdquo; said he to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I said right out, like the simple mountain
person I am, &ldquo;are you the&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, of course, I stopped and turned a strange and beautiful
red, something, I imagine, the color of a faded American beauty
rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said smiling, &ldquo;I am.&nbsp; At
least I hope I am.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, please,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is your name?&nbsp;
I know all about your noble qualities, but I do not know your
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;is Vance
Gr&eacute;vy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; was all I could say, thinking how this was
probably the particular person madam grandmother had picked out
for me.&nbsp; Of course I couldn&rsquo;t keep back my silly
self-conscious grin, and he smiled in much the same way I
did.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I present you,&rdquo; I said, feeling very
&ldquo;heady,&rdquo; the way Paprika used to on a cold morning,
&ldquo;to my madam grandmother?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have just had the
honor of talking with her.&nbsp; You were so surrounded that I
waited for a moment before venturing to come to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>He
smiled more than ever.&nbsp; I summoned my courage.&nbsp; I think
it was my courage.&nbsp; Perhaps it didn&rsquo;t deserve so good
a name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I inquire what she said to you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you really want to hear?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More than anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you&rsquo;ll not lay it up against me?&rdquo; he
badgered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my honor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then she said: &lsquo;My dear Mr. Gr&eacute;vy, you
are, I take it, the grandson of my old friend.&rsquo;&nbsp; She
put up her lorgnette and looked me over.&nbsp; &lsquo;Yes, you
are the living image of him!&nbsp; Ah, your grandfather and I
were good friends indeed, at one time, I assure you.&rsquo;&nbsp;
&lsquo;How I regret,&rsquo; I said, &lsquo;that he had two
generations the advantage of me.&rsquo;&nbsp; The dear little
thing let me kiss her hand.&nbsp; &lsquo;You have his turns of
speech, also,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; Then she asked: &lsquo;Have
you seen my granddaughter, the only child of my dear
Jack?&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I am on my way to it,&rsquo; I
declared.&nbsp; &lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;we must see to
it, we Knoxes and Ravanels, we Bryces and Gr&eacute;vys, that she
makes no mistakes, must we not?&rsquo;&nbsp; She looked at me
again through her lorgnette, appealing apparently to my
chivalry.&nbsp; <a name="page107"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
107</span>&lsquo;We are a solid phalanx,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;to
see that she comes to no harm.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;We understand
each other,&rsquo; she said with satisfaction.&nbsp; &lsquo;Your
family never did need superfluous words.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>I laughed and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a friend, Mr. Rowantree,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;who likes to tell me about the comedy of manners.&nbsp;
Isn&rsquo;t that what madam grandmother plays all of the
time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just!&nbsp; But isn&rsquo;t she exquisite?&nbsp; A
survival of a splendid old time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&nbsp; Oh, you can&rsquo;t think how I admire and
love her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I can.&nbsp; I can very easily think how you
do.&nbsp; Shall you confine yourself in your associations, Miss
Knox, to the Ravanels and the Gr&eacute;vys?&nbsp; Why not cut
out the Ravanels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t many of them left, are there?&rdquo;
I asked more gravely.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you&mdash;shall I have
many Gr&eacute;vy&rsquo;s to choose from?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s my great aunt and my mother and my
married brother and some second cousins&mdash;nice girls they
are, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s quite a selection.&nbsp; Now tell me
about my Carin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But just then, of course, we were <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>interrupted, and the only other
times I got a chance to talk with him was when we were dancing
together.&nbsp; That was quite a number of times, because I had
him put down three dances for you, and I acted as your
substitute.</p>
<p>All joking aside, Carin, I saw as much of him as I could
because I was determined to find out what he was like.&nbsp; He
would have to be so very, very fine to be worthy of you.&nbsp; I
can see, my dear, partly from what you say and still more from
what you do not say, that this is a serious matter with
you.&nbsp; So I dropped all my nonsense and was grave with him,
and he was grave with me, and I liked him&mdash;Oh,
tremendously.&nbsp; He is earnest and ambitious and full of the
new time.&nbsp; He doesn&rsquo;t care any more about family than
is right and sensible, and he&rsquo;s determined to be a fine and
successful man on his own account.&nbsp; What is more, he
appreciates you, Carin!&nbsp; He does!&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t
rest till I had found out whether he did or not.&nbsp; It is
unnecessary to say what a gentleman I think him; and though he is
not exactly handsome, he has a manliness and a grace that is even
better.</p>
<p>Yes, my blessings are all ready for you.&nbsp; Just <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>let me know
whenever I am to bestow them.</p>
<p>Annie Laurie has a tiny, beautiful little diamond on a thread
of gold which she wears on the little finger of her left
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Annie Laurie,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that ring looks as
if it had a history.&nbsp; It has a kind of a
we&rsquo;d-better-wait-a-while-before-we-tell-our-friends
look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it, impudent one?&rdquo; she laughed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, then it looks to be just what it is.&nbsp; Sam gave
it to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good Sam Disbrow,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be a fine person to live with&mdash;not
ashamed in the wrong place nor proud at the wrong time, nor too
selfish nor too unselfish&mdash;just sensible and reliable and
honest straight through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He and I understand each other,&rdquo; said Annie
Laurie softly, &ldquo;perfectly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course you do.&nbsp; Why shouldn&rsquo;t you?&nbsp;
Haven&rsquo;t you taken years and years to get acquainted?&nbsp;
Tell me, does he ever hear anything of his adopted father, and
his family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not a thing,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not one
thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They just &lsquo;went west.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any other news?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Annie Laurie burst out laughing.</p>
<p><a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t I, just?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;About whom, then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Haystack Thompson.&nbsp; Did you know he was courting
Hi Kitchell&rsquo;s &lsquo;ma&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did.&nbsp; I saw him with a collar on, and no
violin.&nbsp; He had combed his hair; and she wore white cotton
gloves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we all thought it was settled.&nbsp; The only
thing that worried us was how Haystack was to care for a wife
when he got one.&nbsp; He has always been more or less like Tommy
Tucker, singing for his supper&mdash;or rather, playing on Betsy,
his violin.&nbsp; But for a time the violin had to stay in the
background, which made some of us feel rather sad.&nbsp; We
hardly liked to have Haystack settle down like other folks and be
domestic and regular.&nbsp; But we needn&rsquo;t have
worried.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; Little Mrs. Kitchell got a new gray
Henrietta, and a gray velvet hat with a real plume, and made
herself twelve new of everything, aprons included, and there was
general excitement.&nbsp; The ladies about town began to give her
presents and to insist that they should all be invited to the
wedding, and to ask when <a name="page111"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 111</span>it was to be.&nbsp; But Mrs.
Kitchell didn&rsquo;t quite know.&nbsp; &lsquo;Very soon,&rsquo;
she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;In a week or two.&rsquo;&nbsp; She said
that for quite a while.&nbsp; Then one morning, Haystack
disappeared.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Annie Laurie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he did.&nbsp; Just disappeared.&nbsp; He took
Betsy the violin, and left all his new collars behind.&nbsp;
Likewise his suit of blue diagonal that he was to have been
married in.&nbsp; That was all, except a bunch of bittersweet
berries tied with grass, which poor little Anne Kitchell found on
her account book.&nbsp; Under it he had written the word
&lsquo;Good-bye.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did she take it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, she sent for Aunt Zillah, and of course Aunt
Zillah hurried right over to her and kept giving her dry
handkerchiefs till she got over the worst of it.&nbsp; I think
Aunt Zillah made the reason of his defection clear to her.&nbsp;
&lsquo;You couldn&rsquo;t shut Mr. Thompson up in a house and
keep him there any more than you could a catamount,&rsquo; she
told her.&nbsp; &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a wander man and a music
man.&nbsp; What would he be if he were to settle down and play a
respectable part?&rsquo;&nbsp; Little Anne Kitchell admitted
it.&nbsp; I liked him because he was so <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>different
from other folks,&rsquo; she said.&nbsp; &lsquo;He didn&rsquo;t
seem to have no care nor trouble, but I suppose if I&rsquo;d
married him, he would have had.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;Of course he
would,&rsquo; said Aunt Zillah.&nbsp; &lsquo;He would have had
stepchildren, and they might not have liked him.&nbsp; And you
would have wanted him to be proper and regular in his habits, and
he would have fretted like a caged hawk.&rsquo;&nbsp; &lsquo;I
reckon it&rsquo;s all for the best,&rsquo; said Anne Kitchell,
and dried her tears.&nbsp; So no more has been heard from
Haystack.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s free again, drinking out of springs,
sleeping in the woods, playing his violin to squirrels and
children and lovers.&nbsp; As for Anne Kitchell, she is wearing
her fine clothes and is setting her cap for a heavy-set man who
has just come to town and set up a feed store.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, Carin, isn&rsquo;t that fun?&nbsp; And aren&rsquo;t you
glad Haystack Thompson got off?&nbsp; I&rsquo;d hate to have
civilization trap him, wouldn&rsquo;t you?</p>
<p>Well, well, I started to tell you about my ball.&nbsp; It was
a wonderful ball.&nbsp; We danced in the drawing-room under the
luster candelabra, and we danced down the long corridor with the
carved panels.&nbsp; We women were all shining in beautiful
garments, but I haven&rsquo;t any <a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>desire to describe them to you,
except that my little grandmother wore a gown of cloth of silver
and rose point lace and all of her diamonds; and I, to please
her&mdash;and it almost drove poor Aunt Lorena wild&mdash;chose a
queer old silk of hers striped like ribbon grass in white and
greeny-white and faded lilac and mauve.&nbsp; Over it I draped
the thinnest silken lace.&nbsp; Then grandmother gave me a
necklace of darling little pearls, and I had white satin slippers
with little butterflies embroidered on them in greeny-white and
faded pink, and a fan of the same colors, painted with butterfly
wings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw a coming-out dress like that in all my
life,&rdquo; said Aunt Lorena.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lorena,&rdquo; said grandmother magnificently,
&ldquo;the Knoxes can afford to do as they please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But for my afternoon reception, to please Aunt Lorena, I wore
drifting white stuff&mdash;white everything&mdash;and carried
Killarney roses, and was just as conventional as I could
be.&nbsp; Aunt Lorena kept pointing to me and saying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the way I want the child to look,&rdquo; and at
the ball grandmother said to her old <a name="page114"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 114</span>friends: &ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you
think she was one of us all over again?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you
like a young girl to dress like that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Everybody agreed with Aunt Lorena, and everybody agreed with
grandmother.&nbsp; And I was very happy all of the time.</p>
<p>No, I find I&rsquo;m not going to describe the ball.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Oh, because it was vague, after all&mdash;just meeting strange
people and dancing with strange people, and trying to think of
the right thing to say when people complimented me&mdash;as, of
course, they thought they had to do&mdash;and being looked over
and being told I was a perfect Knox, and hearing the music
always, always, and feeling the dance get into my toes, and
knowing my cheeks were burning and my eyes flaming, and wanting
to put my face down in the cool moss on the bench of the mountain
where the three tulip trees grow, and drink and drink of my
spring till I was cooled in body and spirit.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Yes, Carin, it was like that.&nbsp; I am not ungrateful.&nbsp;
I like this life; a part of me answers to it completely.&nbsp;
Yet, somehow, I <a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>believe it has come too late.&nbsp; I feel that sooner
or later I shall go back to the mountain and stay there.&nbsp; I
miss the red roads and the misty dawns and the still, still
moonlights, with me answering the whippoorwill and the owl.&nbsp;
I miss Ma McBirney and the little graves under the Pride of India
tree.&nbsp; I am just Azalea the mountain girl after all, I am
afraid, though they keep telling me how gay I am and how I fit
into my present life, and congratulating me because I never seem
to be tired.</p>
<p>But I was secretly very tired when at last the week of
festivities was over.&nbsp; There had been a great company of us
at Thanksgiving dinner, and we had seen and tasted all that was
most splendid in the way of Mallowbanks ham and Mallowbanks
turkey, and Mallowbanks artichokes and mince meat, and we had
talked and laughed and sung and danced, and bowed and scraped,
and shaken hands and kissed, and at last it was all over.&nbsp;
Even my darling Annie Laurie and my little Barbara were
gone.&nbsp; And then I went up to my own room and closed and
bolted the door.</p>
<p>Carin, I wept and wept.&nbsp; I was happy, but I wept.&nbsp;
For, someway, after all, this was <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>not my life.&nbsp; It was not the
silver web I meant to weave.&nbsp; It was something that was
being woven for me, and I was only a quite nice little yellow
spider sitting in the midst of it and being admired without doing
a single bit of spinning.</p>
<p>It was not at all what I had planned for myself.&nbsp; I am
doing a great deal of receiving and little or no giving, and it
makes me dissatisfied.</p>
<p>Of course I give some happiness to grandmother, and a new
responsibility to Uncle David and Aunt Lorena.&nbsp; But what of
my vocation?&nbsp; What of all the things I learned to do with
these two hands of mine?&nbsp; What of the friendships I made
with humble people and needy ones?&nbsp; What of all the good I
was going to do in the world?</p>
<p>Carin, I am very happy.&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t think anything
else.&nbsp; But I have cried a tremendous lot, and I&rsquo;m
going to cry when I feel like it.&nbsp; And by and by I shall do
something.&nbsp; It will not be liked very well at
Mallowbanks&mdash;at least, not at first.&nbsp; But we have to be
our true selves, don&rsquo;t we?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t we owe that
to&mdash;well I don&rsquo;t know just Whom or What we owe it <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>to.&nbsp;
But we are made so much ourselves that to be anything other than
ourselves is to offend what Kipling calls the God of Things as
They Are.</p>
<p>Dear me, am I too serious?&nbsp; I, who have been making an
art of gayety?&nbsp; I can talk nonsense endlessly, and I rather
like to do it.&nbsp; It excites me.&nbsp; I feel like a young
colt when it gets the bit in its teeth and whips off down the
road.&nbsp; Then, if the person I am talking with, feels the same
way, and the two of us dare the other to see who can run away the
hardest&mdash;as Mr. Vance Gr&eacute;vy does, for
example&mdash;then I enjoy myself very much indeed.&nbsp; Running
away is, I can see, very pleasant for a time.</p>
<p>But after all, I am not of a nature to run very far.&nbsp; I
can always be trusted to come home and stand beside the hitching
post.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s my way.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m dependable old
Azalea after all, and however rattle-brained I may sound, you can
count on me to sober down at the critical moment.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
still, Carin, right beside the hitching post.</p>
<p>The only thing I insist on is being hitched up to my own
post.&nbsp; And I don&rsquo;t believe <a name="page118"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 118</span>Mallowbanks is it.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
a carved, historic, marvelous post.&nbsp; But is it mine?&nbsp;
Well, I&rsquo;ll not think any more just now.</p>
<p>Father and Mother McBirney write contented letters from Bethal
Springs.&nbsp; People have been very nice to them and they are
not lonely.&nbsp; Father is doing well and feels some loosening
up of his &ldquo;j&rsquo;ints.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mother is sewing for
somebody&rsquo;s baby.&nbsp; Trust her to find someone who needs
her.&nbsp; If she was set down in a desert you&rsquo;d probably
find her nursing a sick scorpion.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m going up to see
them soon.</p>
<p>Jim is studying his head off at Rutherford Academy and has
started a Young Men&rsquo;s Christian Association there.&nbsp;
Dear Jim!&nbsp; Who would have thought he could have turned so
good?&nbsp; Jim who used to put little green snakes in my
closet!</p>
<p>Carin, when I see you, if I ever do, I will tell you more
about the ball.&nbsp; It was simply grand.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t you just wish we were riding up old Mount
Tennyson side by side, with the crickets singing in the grass,
and the saddles going creak-creak?</p>
<p><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>Carin, I believe I&rsquo;m going to cry again.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Good-bye</i>,</p>

<p>P. S.&nbsp; There, I told you!&nbsp; See that blob?&nbsp; That

fortune.&nbsp; What does he mean by that?&nbsp; Is he going to
drop me?&nbsp; Carin, he is.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s that kind of a
horrid person who can&rsquo;t forgive one for prosperity.&nbsp;
They&rsquo;ll stand by you in adversity but not in
prosperity.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d just as soon be cut for one as the

<span class="GutSmall">GETTING SETTLED</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: right">Mallowbanks, December 10th.</p>
<p><i>Carin</i>, <i>my love</i>:</p>
<p>I hear you are to go home for Christmas and that all of your
family will be together at the Shoals.&nbsp; I wish I could be
with you, but I must be here, of course, and I suppose that if I
were to be with you, I should be longing to be at
Mallowbanks.&nbsp; That isn&rsquo;t because I am discontented,
but only that there are so many beautiful places in the world
where I would like to be, that I find it difficult to choose.</p>
<p>I often think what a lucky thing it is that a person is born
in a certain spot and is under the impression that she has to
stay there.&nbsp; If we were allowed to flutter around over the
earth before we were born, trying to decide whom we would have
for parents and where we would live, what a state of indecision
we should be in!</p>
<p><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 121</span>But
here I am, with my own grandmother, in the home of my ancestors,
making Christmas presents, and having&mdash;Oh, astonishing
fact!&mdash;all the money I want to spend on them.&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;m not buying things.&nbsp; I mean I&rsquo;m not buying
already-done things to any great extent.&nbsp; I am making
them.&nbsp; I want my loved ones to realize that it is still love
that I am sending them, and not just a sign and token of my
prosperity.</p>
<p>There are all the Carsons and all the McBirneys and all the
Summerses and all the Kitchells and all the Paces and all the
Rowantrees, to make things for.&nbsp; Of course I count Keefe in
with the Rowantrees, though I&rsquo;m not sure he would like to
have me.</p>
<p>Speaking of Keefe, I wrote him a letter and told him what I
thought of him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keefe,&rdquo; I wrote, &ldquo;you are haughty.&nbsp;
How have I come to fall in your esteem?&nbsp; Why am I suddenly
&lsquo;Miss Knox&rsquo; instead of Azalea.&nbsp; Do you think I
ought to suffer a steady average of trouble, and because I have
found my people and my fortune, are you going to make me
miserable by turning against me?&nbsp; What harm does it do the
world if I am happy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He wrote back at once, of course.&nbsp; If he <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>hadn&rsquo;t, I never should have written to him
again.&nbsp; Never.</p>
<p>He said he had no idea he had the power to make me
unhappy.</p>
<p>I wrote back and asked him since when had he stopped telling
the truth.&nbsp; And I said I could see he was looking around for
ways of discontinuing our friendship, and that at first I had
been rather stupid and hadn&rsquo;t seen what he was trying to
do.&nbsp; But now I understood, and naturally, I would protest no
more.</p>
<p>Then I got a letter from him which&mdash;well, which changed
everything.&nbsp; He said he had not been sure but that I meant
to enter upon a new life altogether, and if I had, he did not
mean to stand in the way.&nbsp; He said we had been thrown
together by accident and that he had forced his acquaintance upon
you and me, and that we had been endlessly kind to him, but he
did not mean to take advantage of that kindness, but that if I
wished to continue our friendship upon the old basis that it
would make all the difference in the world to him; that he had
had no heart for work or life since the idea had come to him that
he ought to let our friendship go in justice to me.</p>
<p><a name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>Well,
of course I had guessed from the first that all the trouble came
from some absurd idea like that!</p>
<p>So I wrote him that my friendships did not depend on the state
of the money market.&nbsp; But I didn&rsquo;t say, Carin, that I
would rather talk with him than anyone I ever met (except you,
sister of my heart).&nbsp; Perhaps he will never know that.&nbsp;
He said he would love to come down and see me, but that, to be
quite frank, he couldn&rsquo;t afford it just now.</p>
<p>That reminded me of an old idea of mine.&nbsp; So that night I
said to grandmother:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think, madam grandmother, that you
ought to have a portrait painted of yourself as you are
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; cried my grandmother.&nbsp; &ldquo;At my
age!&nbsp; Why, my dear, I am hideous!&nbsp; A wrinkled,
white-headed, shriveled old woman!&nbsp; What do I want of a
portrait?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then she arose and said as she often does: &ldquo;Your arm,
Azalea, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I gave her my arm, guessing that she was going once more to
show me the portraits of herself in the paneled hall.&nbsp; And
sure enough she did.</p>
<p><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
124</span>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; she said, stopping before the first
one, &ldquo;was by the greatest portrait painter in the
South.&nbsp; At the time he painted me I was eighteen and already
engaged to your father&mdash;your grandfather, I mean.&nbsp; I
should not like to have you repeat it, but the painter fell
desperately in love with me, my dear&mdash;desperately.&nbsp;
Painters always fall in love with one, I fancy.&nbsp; That is why
the picture has a slightly unfinished appearance.&nbsp; He left
before he had quite completed it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor man,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I dare say he recovered.&nbsp; These loves that are
founded on mere admiration amount to but little.&nbsp; We will
proceed, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I led her on to the next portrait of herself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This,&rdquo; she said, quite as if she had not told me
the same things half a dozen times before, &ldquo;was done by an
English artist just after my Jack was born.&nbsp; I wanted him to
paint it with my little David sitting at my feet and my Jack in
my arms, but he was not in favor of it.&nbsp; He said he
preferred to paint me by myself.&nbsp; For one thing, he
considered me too small to paint with such fine large sons.&nbsp;
He said it made me look ridiculous.&nbsp; But I <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>truly
think, Azalea, that he did not regard me as motherly
enough.&nbsp; I know I was and am a vain woman.&nbsp; But my
vanity, my dear, is only skin deep&mdash;only skin deep.&nbsp; It
is a manner, nothing more.&nbsp; In my time it was fashionable
for girls in my class to act as if they were self-indulged and
vain.&nbsp; But in reality&mdash;&rdquo; she paused, and stood
out before me, and I saw there were tears in her eyes, and her
face grew tender and quiet&mdash;&ldquo;in reality, my dear
granddaughter, my motherhood was more to me than anything
else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She drooped her head down among the laces on her gown, and I
heard her say under her breath:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have almost died of it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I put my arm around her and drew her close to me&mdash;such a
tiny creature as she is!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little madam grandmother,&rdquo; I whispered,
&ldquo;come back to the fire, and I will make some tea.&nbsp;
Then perhaps you will tell me a story.&nbsp; I love your stories
very, very much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She straightened up again, calling on her courage and her
pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is one more portrait which I wish to show
you, my dear.&nbsp; It was done by <a name="page126"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 126</span>a celebrated South American when I
was just turned forty&mdash;my autumnal picture, I call it.&nbsp;
Here I am, in my spring, in my summer, in my autumn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She smiled up at me suddenly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, I suppose, you wish me to round out my year,
and have my winter picture painted?&nbsp; Well, I can provide the
snow.&rdquo;&nbsp; She touched her silver hair with her wrinkled
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dear grandmother,&rdquo; I said right out from the
heart, &ldquo;you are quite right.&nbsp; It needs the beautiful
winter picture to complete the set.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We went back to the fire then and she sat thinking while I
made the tea.&nbsp; At last she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you chance to know anyone who is particularly well
adapted to painting such a portrait, Azalea?&nbsp; For, mind you,
it will no longer be the picture of a beautiful woman; it will be
what is far harder to paint, the record of a character.&nbsp; For
every wrinkle tells its story, if only one is wise enough to
read, and though my eyes are old, they still have their
revelations to make, my dear.&nbsp; Who looks in them can read
the book of experience there.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
127</span>&ldquo;I think I know such an artist,
ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;He has painted many
portraits recently and has had much praise for them.&nbsp; His
name is Keefe O&rsquo;Connor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keefe O&rsquo;Connor,&rdquo; she said musingly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you know him personally, Azalea?&nbsp; But I think I
have heard you say so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is the brother of my dear Mary Cecily
Rowantree,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, the Rowantrees of Rowantree Hall!&rdquo;</p>
<p>She never forgets that the Rowantrees are of Rowantree
Hall.&nbsp; You and I love the ramshackle old place so that we
forget what a grand name it has.&nbsp; Grandmother, I suppose,
thinks of it as a magnificent ancestral estate.&nbsp; What would
she say if she could see that the gallery, instead of being
supported by pillars, is held up by barked chestnut logs, and
that there never has been a second coat of paint on the
place.&nbsp; Ugh, how the wind can blow through those unfinished
rooms!&nbsp; I sometimes think it is the most uncomfortable place
I ever was in.&nbsp; A little mountain cabin is twenty times as
warm and cosy in the winter time.</p>
<p>I would have liked to have told grandmother <a
name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 128</span>all this,
but I knew it would be fatal; that if I did, she would just set
the Rowantrees down as people I ought not to know, so I said
nothing.&nbsp; By and by she remarked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any idea of the prices of your friend&rsquo;s
portraits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again I knew that I must mention a good price to make her
respect him, so I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think he would paint your portrait, grandmother, for
a thousand dollars.&nbsp; And we could entertain him, I
suppose?&nbsp; That would make it so much more agreeable,
wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, we would entertain him, certainly,&rdquo; said
grandmother.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have a room built especially for
studio purposes.&nbsp; I believe you never have seen it.&nbsp; It
is in the west wing, and faces north.&nbsp; There is a bedroom
attached.&nbsp; It always has been the custom of the Knoxes to
have their portraits painted in the house and by someone with
whom they were in daily association.&nbsp; Such intercourse
assists in the understanding so necessary to the production of a
good likeness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I asked her if I had her permission to write to Keefe, and
she said yes.&nbsp; I have written him.</p>
<p><a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>No
more for the present, Carin.</p>
<p>By the way, was I rather down-in-the-mouth in my last
letter?&nbsp; Please forget about it.&nbsp; I suppose it was only
a spell of homesickness.&nbsp; Seeing so many strangers and being
expected to like them all, and to act as if I always had known
them, rather upset me.</p>
<p>But as I said, no more at present.</p>
<p>I do wish you could see the room I call my Christmas
room.&nbsp; It used to be a sort of morning room, but no one sits
in it any more, so I have a work table in there, and my sewing
machine and embroidery frame and my pyrography outfit, and my
photographic stuff, and I am working early and late.&nbsp; Of
course I interrupt myself to do whatever Aunt Lorena or
grandmother wish me to.&nbsp; And people call, and I return
calls, and there are little parties.&nbsp; But I like best to be
working.&nbsp; Outside the window are honey locust trees, and
they are very lovely even when stripped of their leaves.&nbsp; In
the distance, on a hill, is a group of dark hemlock, and now that
the sky is gray, they look particularly solemn.&nbsp; I have a
fireplace in my Christmas room, and young James keeps it so that
I need never be without a blazing <a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>hearth.&nbsp; My wood box is simply
heaped.&nbsp; There are apples on my table, and a funny old
writing desk stands in the corner.&nbsp; It is a terribly messed
up room, and I love it.&nbsp; Not that I&rsquo;m really
disorderly.&nbsp; You wouldn&rsquo;t say I was disorderly, would
you, Carin?&nbsp; Come, now!&nbsp; No, I believe I like it
because I have made it myself.&nbsp; I have in it what I can
use.&nbsp; I am <i>living</i> in it.&nbsp; In the other rooms I
only look on; and that, emphatically, is not living.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>No more for the
present</i>!&nbsp; <i>I mean it</i>!</p>

<p style="text-align: right">Glidden Siding, December 24th.</p>
<p>Merry, merry Christmas, dear Carin.&nbsp; Dear old friend,
<i>such</i> a merry Christmas to you!</p>
<p>I am sitting here in the station, having come from Bethal
Springs on the queerest little train ever you saw, and I am
waiting for the train that is to take me home.&nbsp; It is cold,
and I think it is going to rain.&nbsp; Seeing that I do not
expect to reach home till after dark, this sounds a bit
dismal.&nbsp; Semmy is with me.&nbsp; I wrote you about
Greenville Female Seminary Simms, didn&rsquo;t I?&nbsp; I wanted
to travel alone, <a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>of course, but neither Aunt Lorena nor grandmother
would hear of it.</p>
<p>I have just asked Semmy where she got her name, and she tells
me that her mother was a &ldquo;pore misfortunate so&rsquo;t of a
woman who nevah did git on in de worl&rsquo; nohow.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; jes&rsquo; befo&rsquo; Ah was bo&rsquo;n, she went
fo&rsquo; to wuk in de Greenville Female Sem&rsquo;nary.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; theah dey was dat good to heh, dat she neveh did
see!&nbsp; Yassum, dey jes&rsquo; cheered heh along and heartened
heh up, an&rsquo; nussed heh, and when de baby come&mdash;that
was me&mdash;dey gave heh a whole set of clo&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
An&rsquo; ma she jes&rsquo; had a change of heart.&nbsp;
Yassum.&nbsp; She jes&rsquo; made up heh mind dat she
wa&rsquo;n&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to be downcas&rsquo; no
moah.&nbsp; She might &rsquo;a&rsquo; been misfortunate, but dat
didn&rsquo;t keep de worl&rsquo; f&rsquo;om havin&rsquo; any
numbah o&rsquo; good, kind folk in it.&nbsp; No&rsquo;um.&nbsp;
So she named heh baby fo&rsquo; the Sem&rsquo;nary, she did,
sho&rsquo; &rsquo;nough, and she was glad of it to de las&rsquo;
day of heh life.&nbsp; And Ah was glad of it too.&nbsp;
Greenville Female Sem&rsquo;nary Simms shore am a fine
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;
*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *</p>
<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve been down to see Father and <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>Mother
McBirney.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t let Christmas go by without
visiting them, could I, Carin?&nbsp; I went down on the
twentieth, and had three whole days with them, and a Christmas
celebration of the happiest sort.</p>
<p>The two dears were down to meet me at the train, and they took
me up to their little cottage, which is in the pine woods, with a
very pleasant vista which shows them the river and the river
road, and though they are far enough from the road to be quiet,
they can see the people coming and going.&nbsp; Mother wheels
Father to the springs twice every day, and that gives them little
excursions and helps to pass the time.&nbsp; Father McBirney says
the waters are benefiting him, so that he has hardly any pain at
all now.&nbsp; I can see for myself that the swelling is going
down in his joints.&nbsp; The only thing is he can not walk
steadily yet, and then only a short distance.</p>
<p>Oh, Carin, maybe it wasn&rsquo;t fun to go to them with a big
trunkful of things they needed!&nbsp; I had a suit for Father
McBirney, and a suit for Jim, and a fine Scotch wool dress for
dear Mother, and a knitted jacket for her for common, and a fine
soft black coat for <a name="page133"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 133</span>best, and gloves and stockings and
warm underwear, and pretty curtains for the windows, and a turkey
which Aunt Lorena sent, and a barrel of flour and one of apples
from Uncle David, and some foot warmers and a coffee percolator
from grandmother, and various small things too numerous to
mention from all of us.</p>
<p>Then along in the afternoon of the day that I got there, Jim
came over from Rutherford College, and so we four were all
together again.&nbsp; Yes, Carin dear, there we sat in the little
strange room and looked at each other, and thought of all we had
gone through together, and how we loved each other, and
yet&mdash;</p>
<p>And yet, we knew, each and every one of us, that my path and
theirs had begun to part.&nbsp; Yes, we knew it.&nbsp; They felt
a little differently toward me, and I felt a little differently
toward them.&nbsp; But that didn&rsquo;t keep me from loving my
McBirneys.</p>
<p>Jim had a thousand things to tell me.&nbsp; He has been
studying terribly hard, and he has made some good friends, and is
full of noble, loving ideas.&nbsp; He wants me to be a missionary
<a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>to
foreign lands, and I&rsquo;m afraid I hurt Mother
McBirney&rsquo;s feelings a little when I laughed at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do I look like a missionary, Jim?&rdquo; I asked
him.&nbsp; But he insisted on being serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you have the heart of a missionary,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;that will be all that is necessary.&nbsp; Your looks
don&rsquo;t matter a particle, Zalie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The way he said it, you would have thought I was something
frightful to look at, but that it might be lived down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want very much to help my neighbors along,&rdquo; I
said, &ldquo;and to be helped by them, I hope, but to go to a
foreign country and set up my ideas against theirs doesn&rsquo;t
appeal to me personally.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll have to excuse me,
Jim.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a little while he got off his religious themes and was
just good old jolly Jim, and then we had a fine time.&nbsp; For I
confess that I felt a little strange with him when he talked
religion.&nbsp; We made candy together&mdash;nut candy&mdash;and
we popped corn, and got the supper, and played chess, and had
prayers and went to bed.&nbsp; And the next two days were like
unto this day.</p>
<p>Only, of course, we had our Christmas feast.&nbsp; <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>They
insisted on cooking the turkey and all the other good things
while I was there, so that took a good deal of work, as you may
imagine.&nbsp; But it was great fun, too.&nbsp; The little
cottage reeked with delicious odors, and it was charming to see
with its new curtains and the walls all trimmed with bittersweet
and holly, and the pine knots burning in the fireplace.</p>
<p>Then, this morning, Semmy and I left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget us, Zalie, don&rsquo;t forget
us,&rdquo; dear Ma McBirney said when I kissed her good-bye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never while life lasts, dear,&rdquo; I told her.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Never while I have any brain to remember with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m grateful to you, Zalie,&rdquo; Pa told me,
shaking my hand till it ached.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve given me
comfort and peace, girl, and there ain&rsquo;t a day or a night I
don&rsquo;t thank you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pa,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s hard getting even
with you and Ma, but I&rsquo;m going to do it if I
can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jim took me down to the station and told me he hoped to be a
credit to me, and that he never forgot that he owed his education
to me, and he hoped I wouldn&rsquo;t become worldly.</p>
<p><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>&ldquo;Jim, you old silly,&rdquo; I said to him,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just as worldly as I can be.&nbsp; I simply love
the old world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That, Zalie, is not what I mean, and you know
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lecture me, Jim,&rdquo; I warned him,
&ldquo;or it will make me more and more frivolous.&nbsp; Just
leave me alone and I&rsquo;ll work out my own
salvation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he said he would pray for me.&nbsp; He looked so dignified
that I didn&rsquo;t dare remind him of those little green snakes
he used to put in my closet.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no doubt about
it; Jim is getting ministerial already.&nbsp; Growing up is a
queer thing, isn&rsquo;t it, Carin?&nbsp; Little freckled Jim
trying to make a foreign missionary out of me!</p>
<p>To-morrow we shall have a great celebration at
Mallowbanks.&nbsp; There are to be some &ldquo;kin&rdquo;
present, of course, and we are to have a tree and a great dinner
and in the evening a sing around the fire.&nbsp; I am to sing for
them, alone, at grandmother&rsquo;s request, and I have been
rehearsing.&nbsp; I wish I had a voice like Annie Laurie, rich
and full like a robin, or a thrush-like voice such as your mother
has.&nbsp; I <a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>don&rsquo;t think much of my voice, and I wish they
wouldn&rsquo;t ask me to sing.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll do my best,
and I have some lovely songs.&nbsp; Aunt Lorena plays my
accompaniments.</p>
<p>There, I hear the train coming!</p>
<p>How good it will be to get out of this stuffy little
station.&nbsp; The light is so dim I can hardly see.&nbsp; But
why should I fret?&nbsp; In two hours I shall be in Mallowbanks,
my own home.&nbsp; My own!&nbsp; And I know now, Carin, that it
will be a pretty fine thing to go up to my own room and feel that
I possess it, and to sit at supper with my own people.&nbsp; Yes,
Carin, I realize it more to-night than ever before.</p>
<p>And, dear me, I shan&rsquo;t get in bed till after midnight, I
know, with so many Christmas presents to do up and label and
all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m tying everything with corn-colored ribbon
and it looks very pretty.&nbsp; The little presentation cards
have daffodils on them.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you like dainty things
like that?</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all very silly,&rdquo; said Preacher Jim to
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;This money should have gone to the
poor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;it is going to the
poor.&nbsp; For <a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>everybody in the world is poor.&nbsp; Everybody needs
help.&nbsp; Some need money, but more need love, and all this
silliness is just a girl&rsquo;s way of showing love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; said Jim.</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t he funny, Carin?&nbsp; Who would have dreamed he
would be so solemn?</p>
<p>I do hope you&rsquo;ll like what I&rsquo;ve sent you; and
I&rsquo;m wild to get home and find your package for me.</p>
<p>And Oh, Oh, if there isn&rsquo;t one, what an Indignant Person
I shall be!&nbsp; But there will be, for when have you or your
darling parents forgotten me?</p>
<p>A thousand Christmas greetings to you all.&nbsp; There is no
joy I do not wish you.&nbsp; Salute your hearthstone for me.</p>

139</span>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">THE PORTRAIT</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: right">Mallowbanks, January fifth.</p>
<p><i>Carin</i>, <i>my own one</i>:</p>
<p>Mallowbanks is entertaining an artist&mdash;a painter of
portraits.&nbsp; His name is Keefe O&rsquo;Connor; his residence
is New York.&nbsp; He was wired for imperatively by Madam Knox
who offered him more for the painting of her portrait than he had
previously received for any such commission.&nbsp; Telegrams were
exchanged.&nbsp; The artist, it appeared, was much engaged.&nbsp;
Madam Knox wished more than ever to secure him.&nbsp; She
increased her offer.&nbsp; He came&mdash;he is here in &ldquo;the
artist&rsquo;s suite.&rdquo;&nbsp; Madam Knox sits to him in gray
velvet and pearls.&nbsp; Her hair is as white as the drifted
snow; her eyebrows are dark and pointed, her little mouth looks
secret and proud, her aristocratic nose is a straight line, her
old, beautiful eyes are full of vanity and wisdom, sternness <a
name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>and
kindness, memories and hopes.&nbsp; She is very wrinkled and very
beautiful.&nbsp; The portrait painter appears to be in raptures,
and he works early and late and is growing hollow-eyed.&nbsp; My
own conviction is that he does not eat enough nor sleep very
well.&nbsp; Semmy seems to think he has a secret sorrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Zalie,&rdquo; said she to me&mdash;she learned to
call me Zalie from the McBirneys&mdash;&ldquo;that theah painter
man has somethin&rsquo; gnawin&rsquo; him, suah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The painter man avoids me.&nbsp; When I come near, he
goes&mdash;as soon as politeness permits.&nbsp; I retire to my
room and read his assurances of friendship; I remember my own,
and wonder if my imagination is not running away with me.&nbsp;
But no&mdash;he avoids me.&nbsp; The other day, however, we were
left together at the breakfast table and conversation became
absolutely necessary.&nbsp; What he said was:</p>
<p>&ldquo;How changed you are, Miss Azalea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you don&rsquo;t like the change,
Mr.&mdash;Keefe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My liking or disliking it has nothing to do with the
case,&rdquo; he answered gloomily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I repeat, you are
changed.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I admitted.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
changed a number of times in the course of my life, but so, I
suppose, have others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should you say I had changed for the worse or the
better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a question of better or worse.&nbsp; You
wrote me that you were the same old Azalea, but I do not find you
so.&nbsp; Why, how meek you used to be!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meek!&nbsp; I never was!&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t
be!&nbsp; Meek!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I think of you teaching those mountain children so
lovingly, going around in your little pink sunbonnet, chatting by
the hour with Mrs. Medicine Bottle&mdash;what was her
name?&mdash;and look at you as you are now, and hear you talk as
you do now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will
withdraw my presence and my voice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I did.&nbsp; I ran up to my room, and I found that pink
gingham I used to wear up at Sunset Gap, and the funny little
sunbonnet you used to think too becoming for a
school-teacher.&nbsp; I put on the pink dress, though it was
halfway up to my knees; I let my hair down my back <a
name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 142</span>in braids,
and pulled the sunbonnet over it.&nbsp; Then I waited till I knew
grandmother was sitting for her painter and I got Semmy to go
down and knock on the door and call Mr. Painter out for a
minute.</p>
<p>In that minute I ran in, kissed madam grandmother and bribed
her to get behind a screen, and when our portrait painter
returned, I was on the dais looking as demure as a kitten.</p>
<p>He came in looking at a letter Semmy had given him, and
said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you pardon me, ma&rsquo;am, for one
moment?&rdquo;&nbsp; He glanced through his letter.&nbsp; Then he
bowed, and took up his brushes again.&nbsp; That was when he saw
me.&nbsp; He gave a sort of a gasp and broke into the good old,
beautiful smile we used to see on him up at Sunset Gap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Azalea!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>Then he frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not like to paint a person in masquerade,&rdquo;
he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But this,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is a return to
type.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He still frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you don&rsquo;t like the type?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not answer.</p>
<p><a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>&ldquo;Are we keeping Madam Knox waiting?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>I dropped a curtsy and found grandmother behind the
screen.&nbsp; She too, was looking not particularly well
pleased.</p>
<p>I kissed her again and helped her up to her chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grandmother,&rdquo; I explained, &ldquo;was not a party
to the deception which has moved you to such violent rage, Mr.
O&rsquo;Connor.&nbsp; She was taken by storm; was overcome by
force of arms and a superior enemy.&nbsp; I withdraw.&nbsp; I
never did see why anybody wanted to go to the Arctic
regions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I curtsied again&mdash;twice&mdash;once to grandmother and
once to him.&nbsp; They both looked sulky.&nbsp; I got into my
riding habit, called for Sally McLean, the darling little mare
they let me use, and went off for the rest of the morning.&nbsp;
At noon I found myself at the house of a Ravanel&mdash;Delight
Ravanel.&nbsp; She is a spinster, quite wrinkled and rather
depressed, but she got her Christian name when she gave promise,
I suppose, of other things.&nbsp; She asked me to stay to
luncheon.&nbsp; I did, and found her a dear.&nbsp; She told me
stories <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>about who married whom and why.&nbsp; She proved to me
that I was some sort of a cousin of hers.&nbsp; It was the middle
of the afternoon before I started for home.</p>
<p>A rain had set in and the roads were very muddy, so Sally
McLean had a bad time of it.&nbsp; She is such a dainty thing
that mud makes her miserable.&nbsp; Besides, she was shivering
with cold and nervousness, though I can&rsquo;t quite see what
made her nervous.&nbsp; But Sally has her moods, like the rest of
us.&nbsp; I made up my mind, however, that Paprika was the last
horse that was ever going to throw me, and so I gentled poor
Sally, and made my way along the road in the best spirit I could
command.&nbsp; I fell to thinking about little Paprika, and
Jim&rsquo;s Mustard, and how we used to scamper down the long
mountain road to school, and about the times when you and Annie
Laurie and I used to race down the valley; and then I thought
over the excursion Haystack Thompson and Miss Pace and Keefe and
you and I made with Paralee Panther away over the nag road to the
Panther&rsquo;s, and how we dug them out of their cave, so to
speak.&nbsp; I hear from Paralee quite often, by the way.&nbsp;
She <a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>is
teaching now in the Industrial School.&nbsp; Yes, she is really a
teacher, just as she said she would be.&nbsp; Of course that is
owing to the start you gave her, Carin; but I&rsquo;m very proud
to think how she has got on.&nbsp; She has been independent of
all help for two years at least, hasn&rsquo;t she?&nbsp; Perhaps
she has written you about her teacher&rsquo;s position, but I
mention it, thinking she might not have ventured to write.&nbsp;
She always stood in some awe of you, you were so beautiful and so
far removed from her.</p>
<p>She, reminds me, someway, of those people I did not meet in
the little cabin that lay between Mount Tennyson and Mount
Hebron&mdash;the cabin, I mean, where I went in and helped myself
to soup and firewood, and where I left the cake and sugar and
things in exchange.&nbsp; I told you Mother McBirney met them
afterward and learned their name.&nbsp; Wixon, it was, by the
way.&nbsp; Well, just for fun, I sent them some Christmas
presents&mdash;nothing really sensible and necessary, but
something perfectly luxurious&mdash;a talking machine with a lot
of records of various kinds.&nbsp; Also a year&rsquo;s
subscription to a good magazine which has many
illustrations.&nbsp; I thought these <a name="page146"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 146</span>things might help them to become
alive.&nbsp; Oh, it certainly is glorious to have money!</p>
<p>But I am still out in the rain on Sally McLean&rsquo;s back,
in a bad fit of homesickness, am I not?&nbsp; These homesick
spells do not come as often as they did and they are not as bad
as they were, but still I have them, and while they last I am
miserable enough.&nbsp; I could feel my tears trickling down my
cold nose, but I was having such work to keep Sally on her feet
that I couldn&rsquo;t wipe them away.&nbsp; I suppose we made a
pathetic pair, struggling along in the sodden afternoon in that
friendless, forsaken way.&nbsp; (I&rsquo;m not sure but Sally was
crying too.&nbsp; I think I heard her sniffle.)</p>
<p>Then, just as we were in the worst of our dumps, who should
appear on the landscape but &ldquo;a solitary
horseman&rdquo;!&nbsp; He was riding Wellington, a tall, elegant
looking horse belonging to Uncle David, and he himself&mdash;of
course it was Keefe&mdash;looked tall and elegant, too, though he
had on a raincoat and a little cap which fitted close to his
head.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t seem to mind the rain, but rode with
his face turned up to it as if he liked it.&nbsp; When he saw me
he stopped riding that way and <a name="page147"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 147</span>tried to look as commonplace as he
could.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; he said as if we were not very
well acquainted neighbors meeting by chance on the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, thank you, Rain-in-the-Face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are angry with me!&nbsp; You have been away all day
because you were angry with me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fled, Rain-in-the-Face, from the Arctic chilliness of
Mallowbanks.&nbsp; I have in my time lived among strangers, I
have danced and sung to stupid audiences, I have been hungry and
wet through with the rain, I have slept on mouldy straw in a
wretched tent, but never was I so chilled as to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Azalea!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed shocked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean,&rdquo; I asked him, angry, Carin, for one
of the few times in my life, &ldquo;that I ought not to mention
that I was once a poor little waif, a show girl, a sad-hearted
dancer?&nbsp; Yes, I was an ill-cared for, shamed little Infant
Phenomenon, and I don&rsquo;t care who knows it.&nbsp; And then I
was poor Ma McBirney&rsquo;s beloved child, and I took the place
to her of her little dead daughter; that warmed and saved me and
taught me love and faith, and I don&rsquo;t <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>care who
knows that, either.&nbsp; Then I was Carin Carson&rsquo;s friend,
and we worked and learned together, and you saw us, and you liked
me as I was then.&nbsp; Now I&rsquo;m Azalea Knox of Mallowbanks,
with such relatives and acquaintances as Fate has given me, and
I&rsquo;m grateful and proud of that, too.&nbsp; I take all as it
comes, Rain-in-the-Face, and I cannot for the life of me
understand what you are sulking about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I sulking?&nbsp; I am unhappy.&nbsp; How could you
change so?&nbsp; You used not to talk as you do now, nor dress as
you do now.&nbsp; You asked me to forgive you your fortune and
your place in the world, and I liked it and laughed at it
and&mdash;and forgave it.&nbsp; Though it was hard.&nbsp; But
still I didn&rsquo;t want to come down here.&nbsp; I fought
against it.&nbsp; I had too dear a memory of you, Azalea, to want
to come down here in any other way than as your lover, and I knew
it would never be fair to come that way&mdash;that your relatives
would object.&nbsp; So I found one excuse after another for not
coming, but your grandmother over-persuaded me.&nbsp; And my
heart out-argued me, too.&nbsp; I had to come.&nbsp; I thought:
&lsquo;All the <a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>world may change, but she never will.&nbsp; She will be
the same.&rsquo;&nbsp; But you aren&rsquo;t&mdash;you
aren&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you?&rdquo; I retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you imagine
for a moment, Rain-in-the-Face, that after three years in New
York City, making your way among artists and other clever,
charming people, that you are the same boy who went singing over
Sunset Gap?&nbsp; You are not, at all.&nbsp; Now you are not
afraid to be rude or disagreeable or masterful, but then you
would not have been one of those things.&nbsp; You were too
kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you think me unkind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horribly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am sorry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m sorrier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can I do to make you change your mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reform.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I stay here where you are, I shall say something to
be regretted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who will regret it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I.&nbsp; Your uncle and aunt, above all, your
grandmother, will look on me as an adventurer.&nbsp; They will
even accuse you of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>I
could see him turn scarlet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of having asked me down here knowing that&mdash;that I
was fond of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what of that?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not ashamed of
that.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t believe that girls have to sit around
without making any effort to get what they want in
life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carin, you are horrified, aren&rsquo;t you?&nbsp;
Darlin&rsquo;, it just slipped out.&nbsp; But it was the
truth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean&mdash;&rdquo; he cried, putting his horse
up beside Sally McLean.&nbsp; But I told you Sally was in a
mood.&nbsp; She didn&rsquo;t like that way of doing things.&nbsp;
Perhaps she thought he meant to brush me off of her, or maybe she
imagined that it was a race.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t say, because
Sally and I do not understand each other very well yet.&nbsp; But
at any rate, she was off down the road, mud or no mud, and I did
not even try to hold her in.</p>
<p>I could hear Keefe thundering along behind me, crying:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you hold her?&nbsp; Throw yourself
off.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But not I.&nbsp; I let her go as fast as she wished.&nbsp; <a
name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>At least,
until I got near home and on the macadam, and then I gently drew
her in.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know but she might be beyond all
reason by that time, but she wasn&rsquo;t, and I felt terribly
ashamed of having let uncle&rsquo;s fine mare get in such a
fume.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do hope and pray, Sally,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;that I
haven&rsquo;t ruined your disposition with my wretched
temper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then it came over me that there was nothing at all the
matter with Sally&rsquo;s disposition.&nbsp; The trouble was all
with me.&nbsp; I had been in a trembling rage all day and the
sensitive creature had taken it from me.&nbsp; I was disgusted
with myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Little Sally,&rdquo; I whispered in her ear as I
dropped off her at the house door, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never, never
act like that again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She has wonderful eyes.&nbsp; I wish I had eyes like that
creature.&nbsp; She looked at me straight and we kissed and made
up.&nbsp; That is to say, I made the boy hold her till I got her
some sugar, and I told him to rub her down well and blanket her
and feed her very lightly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She got a little excited,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; It was
young James, and he looked at me curiously.&nbsp; <a
name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 152</span>I wondered
if he, too, saw that I was the excited one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yassum,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;No-um.&nbsp;
Yassum.&rdquo;&nbsp; I thought it covered the ground.</p>
<p>I saw Keefe swinging around the drive just then, and I ran
straight up to my room.</p>
<p>Oh, Carin, how safe and sweet it seemed there.&nbsp; I called
Semmy and had her draw my bath and help me off with my wet
things, and I told her to lay out my new flame-colored
silk.&nbsp; It is gorgeous in hue but modest in make.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For dull nights,&rdquo; said Aunt Lorena when she gave it
to me.&nbsp; &ldquo;A country house, my dear, can be particularly
gloomy.&nbsp; I trust you to brighten this one up at such
times.&nbsp; Perhaps you can do it successfully without the aid
of a flame-colored gown, but in case&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; Well, I
put on the flame-colored dress; likewise the slippers that went
with it.&nbsp; No jewels.&nbsp; I have only my little pearls, and
the gold beads and the amber ones.&nbsp; The dress would have put
any of those out.&nbsp; I did my hair low.&nbsp; I took off my
one ring.&nbsp; The dress, I thought, could have the whole road
to itself.</p>
<p>I was one minute late to dinner, and grandmother was watching
for me.</p>
<p><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>&ldquo;Madam grandmother,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;will
you do me the honor?&rdquo;&nbsp; I gave her my arm, and we went
out to the dining room.&nbsp; Grandmother, of course, always
precedes the others.</p>
<p>I minded my manners and did not speak till I was spoken
to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where were you to-day, Azalea?&rdquo; asked Aunt
Lorena.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not in your room, I know.&nbsp; You should
not go out, child, without letting us know where you were
going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I apologized.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I went for a little ride, Auntie, and the imps took
hold of my bridle and led me farther than I meant.&nbsp; I
lunched with Miss Delight Ravanel.&nbsp; You wished, I think, to
have me with the Ravanels as much as possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was your grandmother who recommended the Ravanels to
you particularly, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank whoever it was.&nbsp; I had a beautiful
time.&nbsp; Miss Ravanel is as quaint as an old gift book, and as
lonely as&mdash;as a rook.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rooks are not lonely,&rdquo; said Keefe.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They go together in swarms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lonely rooks are lonely,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
154</span>&ldquo;I hope Miss Ravanel had received the apricot jam
I sent her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a note from her, aunt, to that effect.&nbsp; She
has been meaning to thank you in person.&nbsp; She also&mdash;in
the note&mdash;begs that I may spend the next fortnight with
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should you like to?&rdquo; asked Uncle David in great
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, immensely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Azalea!&rdquo; cried Aunt Lorena
incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not?&nbsp; You advised me to make new
friends.&nbsp; I have.&nbsp; She is my new friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Delight Ravanel is old enough to be your
mother!&nbsp; And she&rsquo;s always raging at things and
people.&nbsp; How can you possibly endure her for two
weeks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was very pleasant indeed to-day.&nbsp; Perhaps she
is grouchy because she is lonely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Azalea,&rdquo; gasped my grandmother, &ldquo;what was
the word you used?&nbsp; Grouchy?&nbsp; What does that mean,
pray?&nbsp; No such word was in use in my day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I saw myself as I was, a very naughty young person,
setting all these lovely folks at odds.</p>
<p><a name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
155</span>&ldquo;It means what I am to-night&mdash;cross and
hateful, dearest grandmother.&nbsp; Please, please forgive me for
using it.&nbsp; I ought never to use anything but the nicest
words I know in your presence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I picked up her little wrinkled hand and squeezed it, and she
looked at me as I love to have her, with something of the love in
her eyes which she gave in the old days to my unforgotten,
wayward father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Lorena,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;she really does want
me to visit her.&nbsp; But I&rsquo;ll make it a weekend instead
of two weeks if you think best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We couldn&rsquo;t spare you for two weeks,
Azalea,&rdquo; said Uncle David kindly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Make it a
week-end, do.&nbsp; For my part, I am glad you like her.&nbsp;
Particularly glad.&nbsp; She is a lonely and hurt soul, is poor
Delight, who delights nobody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that, Carin, things I had heard came back to me, and I knew
she once had loved uncle.&nbsp; It must be a terrible thing to
love someone, always, who cares nothing for you.&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t think of anything worse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I already had made up my mind to like her,&rdquo; I
said.</p>
<p><a name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>When
we went to the drawing-room it was raining so terribly, and the
wind was blowing so wildly, that the great room was
unbearable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go to the writing room,&rdquo; said Aunt
Lorena.</p>
<p>The writing room is a delightful little place, mostly occupied
by a great sofa.&nbsp; There is a wide fireplace, too, and seats
coming out from it at right angles.&nbsp; Young James built a
great fire for us, and Semmy brought in some marvelous nut
candies she had made, and Martha served the coffee there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No light but the firelight, please, Lorena,&rdquo;
commanded grandmother.</p>
<p>So we sat there by the light of the fire and listened to the
storm.&nbsp; Uncle and auntie were together on one of the
cushioned benches beside the fire; grandmother was on the huge
lounge, wrapped in her camel&rsquo;s hair shawl and heaped about
with pillows; I sat down on the other bench beside the
fire.&nbsp; Keefe looked at me a moment as if undecided what to
do.&nbsp; Then he bowed and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have I your permission?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said I as simply as I could.&nbsp; So
we sat side by side for the first time in all our <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>lives, and
after a time&mdash;after quite a time&mdash;I felt his hand
touching mine under the folds of my flame-colored dress.&nbsp; It
has a scarf to it, that floats from the shoulders.&nbsp; It is
quite vol&mdash;how do you spell it?&mdash;voluminous.&nbsp; That
is why we could hold hands.</p>
<p>But I was afraid uncle and auntie were watching us.&nbsp; So I
had an idea.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, dearest dear grandmother,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;this is the night of all the world for a story.&nbsp;
Grandmother, you <i>must</i> tell us a story&mdash;if you
<i>please</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grandmother gave a little laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will do it,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will tell
you the story of an ancestress of yours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I have partly written that story, Carin, and when I have
finished it I shall send it to you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Love&mdash;love from</i></p>

158</span>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="GutSmall">GRANDMOTHER&rsquo;S STORY</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: right">Mallowbanks, January 8th.</p>
<p><i>Carin</i>, <i>my waiting one</i>:</p>
<p>Play you are sitting in the firelight with all my family, and
Keefe close beside me, and the rain falling outside.&nbsp; If the
wind whistles down the chimney, it is, after all, not loud enough
to drown my little grandmother&rsquo;s voice, for it is a high
and musical one, and rises above noises louder than itself.&nbsp;
Very snug and happy we all are.&nbsp; It is a witching hour, and
grandmother looks unearthly and shining, with her hair gleaming
in the firelight like a silver cloud in the sun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once on a time,&rdquo; said she, beginning her story in
the good old way, &ldquo;there was an ancestress of yours,
Azalea, my dear, named Dorothy Marshall.&nbsp; She was so gentle
and sweet a woman that long, long after she was dead, the fame of
her lived on, though no <a name="page159"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 159</span>woman ever led a quieter life than
she did.&nbsp; They say she had fair hair and dark blue eyes,
with a complexion not pale, but golden, and ripe, full lips, and
a beautiful dimple in her chin.&nbsp; In her youth she was a
gallant horsewoman and she could sail a boat like a man.&nbsp;
Indeed, it was the sea that she loved the best, though she grew
up amid beautiful fields and was often in the mountains.&nbsp;
But to be within sound and sight of the sea, and to have the
smell of it in her nostrils, made her a happy woman indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may have been one of the reasons that when she was
only eighteen she married Samuel Bings.&nbsp; Now the Bings were
a seafaring family if ever there was one.&nbsp; Twelve sons were
there, giants all, and save one, each before he died became the
commander of his own ship on the sea.&nbsp; They were
merchantmen, these ships, in the carrying trade between Norfolk
and ports all over the world, and to this day there are many
strange things in our family which they brought from half around
the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Samuel was the fifth son and of them all the most like
his father, who was a famous <a name="page160"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 160</span>seaman and had been thrice around
the world, and many times about the Horn.&nbsp; When Samuel and
Dorothy were married there was feasting and dancing in the old
Marshall home at Norfolk, and good wishes from high and
low.&nbsp; They were so young, so handsome, so fortunate, that
only one cloud could be discovered anywhere on their horizon, and
that was that either they must be apart, or Dorothy must follow
the fortunes of the sea with her husband.&nbsp; This she would
gladly have done had it not been that her mother, whose only
daughter she was, suffered poor health and could not endure to
have her daughter leave her.&nbsp; So it was decided that Samuel
was to make one journey more, for which he had signed, and that
he would then give up his sailor&rsquo;s life and conduct a ship
chandlery at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With that Dorothy begged him to go with her for one
last journey over the mountains, that they might be together in
solitude for a while.&nbsp; So he took his fine roan, Pacolet,
and she her little mare, Bess, and they rode away for a wonderful
month among the mountains, stopping where they pleased, and
seeing the <a name="page161"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
161</span>homes and plantations of their fellow Virginians, and
everywhere they were entertained with great consideration, for
two handsomer or more charming young people it would have been
difficult to find.&nbsp; Moreover, Samuel loved his horse Pacolet
better than anything in the world save his bride, and to feel
this faithful and spirited steed under him, and to see the fair
face of his love shining with health and joy, was, he thought,
all that any man could ask of fate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it was with a stout heart that at last he sailed
away as commander of his elder brother&rsquo;s merchantman,
<i>The Adventure</i>, carrying cotton to France and tobacco to
Algiers and gold to Constantinople.&nbsp; For you must know,
Azalea, that at that time&mdash;I think it must have been about
1794, America did a good trade among the ports of the
Mediterranean and even beyond.&nbsp; Perhaps, too, if you have
read your history, you will know how the corsairs of the Barbary
States preyed upon these merchantmen, so that it was necessary
for America to place a fleet of battleships to guard the African
coast in order to protect the merchant ships from the
pirates.&nbsp; <a name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>Notwithstanding this, many a ship was held against its
will and its officers and crews made prisoners, and it was a
common thing for notices to be read in American churches, giving
the names of those in captivity in Tripoli or Algiers.&nbsp; Then
would the friends and relatives of the imprisoned men raise money
and buy them out again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Samuel Bings had no fear.&nbsp; The Bings were
brave men and subtle men, and they reckoned with their wits to
keep them out of trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Keep heart of grace, Dorothy, my love,&rsquo;
said Samuel when he bade her good-bye.&nbsp; &lsquo;A year may
pass, or a year and a half at farthest; then shall you see me
home, and never more will I quit shore save by your leave or in
your company.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But hardly had he put to sea when troubles came upon
his bride.&nbsp; First her long-ailing mother died; then three
months after that her father bade her farewell also.&nbsp; So she
was left alone in the world.&nbsp; She had kin in
plenty&mdash;though none of them were very near&mdash;who would
have welcomed her to their homes, but they lived on plantations
out of sight of the <a name="page163"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 163</span>sea, and Dorothy had a mind to be
where she could see it rolling in bringing the brave ships on
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What if <i>The Adventure</i> should land and
Samuel come seeking me and I not be at hand?&rsquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So she chose her a house on the side of the hill that
led up from the wharves, and from its galleries she could see
every ship that came sailing into port.&nbsp; Here she made her a
home, putting into it whatever was most beautiful or treasured
from the old house of the Marshalls, and those curious things
which the brothers Bings had brought her from China and Java and
Japan and the South Sea isles; yes, and from the Bahamas and the
Azores and the Canaries and the Hebrides and all the islands they
had visited.&nbsp; Moreover, she made it her business to build a
fine stable for her husband&rsquo;s beloved horse, Pacolet, so
that he was tended like a king&rsquo;s horse, and every day she
rode him to keep him in form, and she would take him to a certain
place where they could overlook the sea, and the two of them
would stand there like statues, watching the horizon for a sight
of <i>The Adventure</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>&ldquo;The year passed with no word from Samuel.&nbsp;
But Dorothy comforted her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Did he not say I might have to wait a year and a
half a year?&rsquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the year and the half year went by, and it was two
years, and then three, and nothing was heard of the ship at
all.&nbsp; So a dark fear began to grow up in the heart of
Dorothy, and she never missed her church, not only because she
was devout, but because she thought that some time she might hear
the name of her husband read as among those who were lying in one
of the cruel Barbary prisons awaiting a ransom.&nbsp; But never a
word did she hear, and the years rolled by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then came the year 1801 and Tripoli declared war upon
America, and Stephen Decatur was sent to deal with the
treacherous governments of Tangier and Tripoli, and there, after
his victories, he saw to the release of all American
prisoners.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now, surely,&rsquo; thought Dorothy Bings,
&lsquo;my husband will return.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But he did not come, and though his brothers, always
traveling, inquired at all ports if anything had been heard of
him, they never <a name="page165"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
165</span>were able to bring his waiting wife any word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the brothers, compassionate for her youth and her
sorrow, bade her accept her widowhood with courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Samuel is dead,&rsquo; they said.&nbsp;
&lsquo;He has died the death of a sailor and a gentleman, rest
you sure.&nbsp; Be comforted, Dorothy.&nbsp; You loved him well
and he loved you, but he is gone.&nbsp; Accept your sorrow and
find another mate.&nbsp; He would be the last one to wish you to
dwell here alone with your youth going and no child in your house
to comfort you.&nbsp; We, his brothers, bid you seek new
happiness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And indeed the beautiful Mistress Bings might have had
her pick of many gallant gentlemen.&nbsp; But though they sued
her ardently, and though she was lonely with a loneliness beyond
her words to express, she could not bring herself to be the bride
of any one of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;For what,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;if I should
wed me, and some day Samuel should come home, looking for
me?&nbsp; What if he is eating his heart out now in some dungeon
or on some lonely isle, dreaming of me and Pacolet, and I should
take the horse and myself to a new master?&nbsp; <a
name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>No, no, I
could never sleep quiet in my bed, nor Pacolet in his stall, were
we false to him.&nbsp; He trusted us beyond all the world.&nbsp;
We will be faithful.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the years rolled by, and at last silver began to
come in the golden hair of Mistress Dorothy.&nbsp; But her
longing, instead of growing less, increased year by year, so that
she did little else but watch the harbor and the wharves, and to
every sailor man who came up the street, staggering from his long
journey, she called:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pray pardon me, good sir, but have you been
overseas?&nbsp; Then perhaps you will tell me if you saw anyway,
in any port, a tall man with steel blue eyes, named Samuel
Bings.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the sailors, high and low, paid her courtesy,
knowing her sad story, and respecting her for her steadfastness,
and they would stop, hat in hand below her balcony, and tell her
of their voyages, and of what they knew concerning the fate of
missing men.&nbsp; But never a one of them, stranger or friend,
could bring her word of the man she mourned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of this intercourse she came to know many, many
sailors, and since she was <a name="page167"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 167</span>one of those whom sorrow teaches,
they trusted her and came to her in trouble, and brought her
their joys, too.&nbsp; She was the friend to all, and since she
had a liberal soul and a well-filled purse, she was enabled to
help many a poor man in straits, and to send him on his way with
a strengthened heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At length, old age came upon her.&nbsp; She leaned upon
a stick when she walked, and she must needs be wrapped in the
rich shawls brought her from far lands, when she sat upon the
galleries.&nbsp; But still her eyes were bright, and they were
always seeking, seeking, and her voice was sweet though it
quavered as she leaned over her gallery&rsquo;s edge to question
the men who came up from the ships.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;She will never hear from Samuel Bings this side
heaven,&rsquo; the sailor men fell into the way of saying.&nbsp;
And now she was so venerable, and her sad story was so widely
known, that men coming to the port for the first time would
question if she was yet to be seen, and they would salute as they
approached, and would wait to hear the questions that she
asked.&nbsp; She was to them like a ballad of true love, or a
chant grown dear with use.&nbsp; Indeed, <a
name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>they made
songs about her, and when they argued for true love, they were
able to point to her.&nbsp; They venerated her silver hair, which
had once been golden, and it was to the glory of Norfolk that she
lived there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, one day as she sat in the sunshine, watching the
harbor and noting the ships and the busy throng upon the wharves,
and all the business that had become to her as her very life, an
old, bent man, a sailor by his walk and dress, came shambling up
the street.&nbsp; She never had seen him before, but no sooner
had her eyes fallen upon him than her heart gave a great
leap.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Come to me,&rsquo; she called to the faithful
servant who had been her companion since the days when she was a
bride.&nbsp; &lsquo;Come to me and hold me by the arm, for I must
question yonder man.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So the maid supported her, and Mistress Bings got to
the balustrade of her balcony, and leaning over it, called to the
old stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Your pardon sir, but have you been traveling
long and far?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man lifted his cap, and as well as he could for his
bent back, he looked up at the <a name="page169"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 169</span>silver-haired lady on the balcony
above him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Long and far, madam,&rsquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Then I beg you of your goodness to come up here
and talk with me a while.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man hesitated, perplexed at such an
invitation.&nbsp; But she called again:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I beg you of your goodness.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he came, and she asked him to be seated before her,
and then she fixed her burning eyes on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Tell me, sir, have you in all of your travels
ever met a man named Samuel Bings&mdash;a tall man with steel
blue eyes, a sailor, every inch of him?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man stared at her a moment, and then started to
his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Are you,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;his wife,
Dorothy?&nbsp; Had he a horse named Pacolet?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;I knew it!&nbsp; I knew it,&rsquo; cried
Mistress Bings.&nbsp; &lsquo;As soon as ever I saw you coming up
the street, I knew that at last I should hear of him.&nbsp; Oh,
tell me, sir, is he living still?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old man sank into his seat again and hung his huge
head over his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;No, madam, he is dead these ten years
since.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page170"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
170</span>&ldquo;&lsquo;Ah, dead,&rsquo; breathed Mistress
Bings.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is at rest, my Samuel.&nbsp; He is safe in
his last bed.&nbsp; He suffers no longer.&nbsp; May God rest his
soul!&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For a little while she could say no more, only now and
then crying to her maid:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He is at rest.&nbsp; He suffers no
longer.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, when she was calmer, she turned once more to the
bowed stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;For the love of God, sir, tell me all you
know.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So he told her the story of how he had been a small
planter in Jamaica, a man of English birth, and how a great
tobacco merchant of that place had fitted out a ship to convey
his produce to the Turkish ports, and how he, William Hull, had
sailed with her, being minded to take a voyage.&nbsp; They had a
fair crossing, and Hull said to himself that now at last he was
living, now at last, he was seeing life.&nbsp; Then, off the
Tripoli coast, the ship was attacked by corsairs and captured,
and the captain and crew were thrown in prison.&nbsp; In time,
the captain and all of his men save Hull were released, but Hull
was of a restless and quick nature, and would not make friends <a
name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>of his
foes.&nbsp; The jailors complained that he was quarrelsome; twice
he tried to escape and was recaptured; and he openly vowed
vengeance on Tripoli should he ever be a free man again and upon
a ship of his own country.&nbsp; So, what with his
hot-headedness, and the warfare that was on then between America
and the Barbary States, he came under the notice of the dey, who,
regarding him as a dangerous man, had him put in the dungeons
below ground.&nbsp; For a time he was all alone, and he all but
went mad in the solitude, but after a time there was need to put
a dangerous murderer in his dungeon, and he was removed to
another place, and thrown in with an old, half-crazed man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He had been a man of great stature,&rsquo; said
Hull, &lsquo;and it was easy to see, in spite of all his rags and
filth, that he was a gentleman.&nbsp; He greeted me courteously
when I entered, and I said to myself that now I should be able to
hold converse with a fellow-being, but indeed, madam, it was
little enough converse that we held.&nbsp; He could hold to one
theme but a moment or two, and then he would fall under a sort of
spell, and would sit softly mumbling <a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>to himself, as if he were going back
over old scenes.&nbsp; Then he would arouse himself and call to
me.&nbsp; And when I answered him, he would say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;&ldquo;Man, man, if ever you go free, for the
love of God, search out my sweet wife Dorothy and my good horse
Pacolet, and tell them I have not forgot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Sometimes he would sob when he spoke these
words, and sometimes he would call them at the top of his
voice.&nbsp; Again he would whisper them, and often in his sleep
I would hear him muttering: &ldquo;My sweet wife Dorothy and my
good horse Pacolet.&rdquo;&lsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The old stranger stopped in compassion, for Mistress
Bings lay with her face against the high back of her chair, as
colorless as snow.&nbsp; But when she found that he had ceased,
she motioned for him to proceed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;This is the greatest day of my life, save
one,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and that was the day I became a
bride.&nbsp; Do not fear for me.&nbsp; Finish your
tale.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Nine years, lacking three months, we were
together in that dungeon,&rsquo; continued Hull, &lsquo;and then
he died.&nbsp; A sudden cold, a closing of the <a
name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 173</span>lungs, and
he was gone.&nbsp; He passed away in my arms, madam, very
peacefully, and with his last breath he bade me carry messages to
you.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;And you waited all these years, man?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Madam, I knew nothing of the place he called his
home, and though he often tried for hours at a time to remember,
he could not recall them.&nbsp; Never, in all that time, did he
talk lucidly upon any subject at all, save when he spoke of you
and his horse, and then he said no more than I have told
you.&nbsp; It was as if, finding that all things were going from
him, he commanded himself to remember the two beings he
loved.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Yet you knew his name, William Hull?&rsquo; said
Mistress Bings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Aye, madam.&nbsp; When at last my old captain
was able to secure my release, I begged him and the governor to
go with me to the keeper of the prison, and there I told him that
I had but one little favor to ask in return for the years of life
he had wrenched from me, and that was the name of my
companion.&nbsp; So he gave it to me&mdash;Bings.&nbsp; But he
could not tell me from what American port he had sailed, nor
would he give me anything of his story.&nbsp; To <a
name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>this day,
madam, I do not know the fate of his ship or his crew, and I fear
that this tragedy like many others, will be unrecorded to the end
of time.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;To the end of time,&rsquo; whispered Mistress
Bings.&nbsp; &lsquo;To the end of time is a long while, William
Hull.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;So long it will never come,&rsquo; said William
Hull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;But he never forgot?&nbsp; My husband never
forgot?&nbsp; In darkness and solitude and madness, he remembered
me still?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Madam, it was his one joy.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Pacolet is long since dead,&rsquo; said Mistress
Bings.&nbsp; &lsquo;He is buried in a fine field, and a great
bowlder is placed above his grave to mark it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;He loved his horse,&rsquo; said William
Hull.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;May they meet in Paradise!&rsquo; cried Mistress
Bings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;What, madam, the soul of the man and&mdash;and a
horse?&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;May they meet in Paradise,&rsquo; she
repeated.&nbsp; Then she bade William Hull enter her house, and
she feasted him well, and when he had finished, she asked him
concerning his life and his work, and when she found that though
old, <a name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>and
bent and broken, he meant always to follow the sea, a common
sailor before the mast&mdash;the least of all the signed men
because of his bent back&mdash;she cried:</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Not so, William Hull.&nbsp; You shall not so
weary yourself.&nbsp; If you have a mind to stay on land, I will
build you a snug house on one of my plantations; but if you
prefer the sea, I will buy you a yawl, and you can sail from port
to port along our coast here.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So at first William Hull spoke for the sea and the
yawl, but when he learned that she would no longer live in the
house that watched the harbor there being no reason why she
should continue to search the faces of returning sailors, looking
among them for the one she loved&mdash;but would go onto a
plantation and live among her trees and flowers, he elected to
live near her and to be her servant.&nbsp; To the end, he served
her, and she guarded him, he for the sake of a man who, though
bereft of his senses, was still an affectionate friend, she for
the sake of the bridegroom who had never forgotten his love, and
who had been snatched from the sunlight to wither in a dungeon
all his days.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>That
is the tale my grandmother told.</p>
<p>And all the while, Carin, I let my hand stay in
Keefe&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The fire fell low, the wind grew higher, and
the story, you might have thought, would have made us sad.&nbsp;
But it did not do so.&nbsp; Grandmother walked up the stairs to
her room with her head lifted; I saw Uncle David and Aunt Lorena
going down the corridor hand in hand.&nbsp; As for me, I could
have danced.&nbsp; I do not know what Keefe thought, but I heard
him singing &ldquo;Annie Laurie&rdquo; when he reached his
room.&nbsp; I saw then that the story had risen above sorrow into
joy, and when I went to bed I was very, very happy&mdash;happier
than ever before in my life.&nbsp; It is wonderful to know there
is really such a thing as true love in the world, isn&rsquo;t
it?</p>

177</span>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="GutSmall">&ldquo;THE WATERS OF
QUIET&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: right">Mallowbanks, January 21st.</p>
<p><i>My own Carin</i>:</p>
<p>I no longer have a grandmother.</p>
<p>She has gone.&nbsp; She is dead; but we are trying not to
grieve.&nbsp; We are thinking of her as sailing on &ldquo;the
waters of quiet&rdquo; to where her husband and her beloved son
await her.</p>
<p>It was her love for that dead son, my father, that brought
about her death.&nbsp; Soon after I wrote you last, we could see
that a cloud was settling over her spirit.&nbsp; She was very
restless and could not sleep, but would go wandering about the
house if she were not prevented.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon ole Miss has got to studyin&rsquo; about Mars
Jack again,&rdquo; said Semmy to me.&nbsp; Indeed, all of us in
the house could see that this was so.&nbsp; She became suspicious
of us and thought we were watching her to prevent her from going
out to her boy.&nbsp; She thought he was living <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 178</span>again,
young and wayward, with no friend but herself, and though she
seemed to be reasonable enough upon other subjects, in regard to
that she was quite insane.</p>
<p>Martha was set to watch her early and late, and when she was
weary Semmy or I took her place.&nbsp; She was sweet and gay at
moments.&nbsp; One afternoon she showed me her painted fans and
her jewels, and told me they would be mine, some day, and I was
naughty enough to say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But madam grandmother, what shall little Azalea do with
all those?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you think her little string of
&lsquo;Job&rsquo;s tears&rsquo; and a peacock fan made by herself
become her better?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That teased her, as I knew it would.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Azalea,&rdquo; she said in her most earnest
manner, &ldquo;you are a true Knox, and these jewels and fans
will become you.&nbsp; Wear them, not only for your own sake, but
for the credit of your family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I like to think of those last days we spent together.&nbsp;
They were dreamy, and happily-sad&mdash;different from other days
altogether.&nbsp; Keefe was finishing her portrait, but we would
no longer let her sit to him.&nbsp; He caught her <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>expressions
from day to day and made studies of them, and touched up the
portrait by himself.&nbsp; It was wonderful to me to see her
sparkling, wrinkled, aristocratic face, at once so worldly and so
spiritual, growing out of the canvas.&nbsp; Then, when she told
him that he was to make a second copy of it, that I might have
one for my very own, you can fancy my pride and satisfaction.</p>
<p>Well, we had fallen into the way of locking the two doors that
lead from her bedroom, so that if she should be taken with one of
her old wandering spells and should try to slip by Martha, who
had a cot in the room with her, she would be unable to get
out.&nbsp; I slept in the little dressing room next to her that I
might be of assistance to Martha should she need me, and several
times she did, for grandmother insisted on going out to the old
place at the end of the garden.&nbsp; Once she had her jewel case
with her, and insisted that Jack must have the jewels, because he
was going hungry and was sleeping by the wayside, while she and
all the rest of the family lived in luxury.&nbsp; It took me a
long time to quiet her.</p>
<p>But she was so well guarded that we thought <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>no harm
could possibly come to her.&nbsp; But the hour came when we all
failed her.&nbsp; I cannot bear to think of it.&nbsp; No one in
the house can.</p>
<p>It happened this way.&nbsp; I had gone motoring with Uncle
David and Keefe.&nbsp; Aunt Lorena remained at home to be near
grandmother, and Martha was in immediate charge.&nbsp; But Martha
is old, too, and though she is most loyal, she does not always
use the best judgment.&nbsp; At any rate, while Aunt Lorena was
down with the cook talking over Sunday&rsquo;s dinner,
Grandmother sent Martha to call her.&nbsp; She said she wished to
consult with her at once upon some important matter.</p>
<p>So Martha, nothing doubting, went in search of Aunt Lorena,
and when she came back grandmother was missing.&nbsp; She had
been in the little upstairs sitting room, but she was not to be
found there nor in her bedroom.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Martha
wasted a few minutes in looking for her on the second story, and
then she came trembling down to the first floor, her old knees
quaking under her, and looked there without success.&nbsp; Old
James had been tidying up the walk in front of the
house&mdash;for there <a name="page181"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 181</span>had been a rain and a cold wind, and
twigs and branches were lying all about the ground&mdash;and he
said she had not come out.&nbsp; So more time was spent in
searching for her all about the great rambling house.&nbsp; The
servants began looking in the rooms we never use, and then they
ran up to the attic, thinking she might be up there looking over
her chests and boxes as she likes to do sometimes.&nbsp; But she
was not there either.</p>
<p>Then Uncle David, Keefe and I came home.</p>
<p>I had noticed as we swept around the drive which goes by the
east wing of the house, that a certain little side door opening
into the garden, stood ajar, which was curious for this time of
the year.&nbsp; It is a door used only in the summer time, and
then usually by someone who wishes to escape quietly into the
garden without being seen by those in the front of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a cold day for a door to be standing open
like that,&rdquo; I said to Uncle David.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curious,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr.
O&rsquo;Connor, as you go in, be kind enough to close it.&nbsp;
It leads from the little coat room beneath the stairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keefe and I went in together, and then we heard the tumult in
the house.</p>
<p><a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t find your grandmother!&rdquo;
said Aunt Lorena to me, showing her white face at the head of the
stairs.&nbsp; With that it flashed through me at once that she
had escaped by the side door.&nbsp; I flung off my motor coat and
ran for the coat room and through the door into the garden.&nbsp;
There, sure enough, by the narrow brick terrace was the imprint
of her little shoe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Keefe, come,&rdquo; I called, for I felt there
was great trouble ahead, and I wanted him to be with me,
Carin.&nbsp; Yes, I can tell you, my dear, to whom every event,
almost every feeling of my life, is known, that I wanted him
above everyone else in the world.</p>
<p>It was almost dark by this time, and the two of us ran out,
hand in hand, and down the gray garden in the mist.&nbsp; Nothing
looked natural to me.&nbsp; The very shrubbery, wreathed all in
white as it was, frightened me.&nbsp; The bushes looked like
strange, unheard-of beasts, crouching to spring.&nbsp; And the
whole place was so terribly still!&nbsp; I could feel my breath
catching in my throat and strangling me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is at the end of the garden she goes to meet
him,&rdquo; I managed to say through my throat.</p>
<p><a name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>&ldquo;To meet whom?&rdquo; asked Keefe.&nbsp; (I never
had told him the story of my father.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her dead son,&rdquo; I gasped, and said no more.&nbsp;
For how could I explain then?&nbsp; Keefe looked at me as if he
thought I was out of my head, but I said nothing, and we ran
on.</p>
<p>And then we came to the pool&mdash;the little sweet pool that
is like the heart of the garden.&nbsp; The three swans were close
to the shore looking at something dark that lay there.</p>
<p>And it was she, Carin.&nbsp; It was little madam
grandmother.&nbsp; She had fallen with her face in the water, and
it seemed as if she had not even tried to rise.</p>
<p>Keefe saw her and sprang to her and picked her up in his arms,
and I came and looked at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She has gone where she wished to go,&rdquo; said
Keefe.&nbsp; &ldquo;She is with her son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am sure it is as she would like it to be,&rdquo;
I cried, and I held her hand in mine all the way to the house,
and wondered if she knew I was glad for her&mdash;that I was
congratulating her.</p>
<p>But, Oh, Carin, how one&rsquo;s throat can ache!&nbsp; How
one&rsquo;s heart can hang heavy, like a weight!&nbsp; <a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>How
one&rsquo;s eyes can burn and head can throb, and how one&rsquo;s
thoughts can heavily turn and turn, like an iron wheel!&nbsp; Did
you ever have a great sorrow?&nbsp; Oh, yes, I remember that you
did, when your three brothers were lost in that horrible theater
fire.&nbsp; Well, I have had a great sorrow before, too, when I
lost my little mother.&nbsp; But I was so young then and so
generally miserable, and life had been hideous for so long, that
it was only one added pang.&nbsp; It was different from
this.&nbsp; I seem unable to get that scene in the garden out of
my mind.&nbsp; Grandmother seems still to be fluttering before
those portraits of herself, or in among the cabinets in the
drawing-room, or along the corridors, beckoning to her old
Martha, or calling out to me: &ldquo;Your arm, Azalea,
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The funeral was strangely quaint and beautiful.&nbsp; So many
old people came&mdash;old friends from far away as well as near
at hand, and I cannot begin to tell you about the curious coaches
and carriages that some of them came in.&nbsp; The bishop
preached the service, the funeral being held, oddly enough, in
the old ballroom of the house&mdash;the room where grandmother
had danced as a bride.&nbsp; But it looked <a
name="page185"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 185</span>very
imposing and solemn on the day of her burial.&nbsp; It is paneled
in dark wood, and all about it were candles burning in their
sconces, and from grandmother&rsquo;s coffin trailed a great
cloth of gold and black brocade.</p>
<p>The bishop had a voice like an organ, and when I heard him
reading:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the resurrection and the life,&rdquo; my sorrow
seemed to lighten.</p>
<p>Everyone was very kind to me&mdash;much kinder than I had any
right to expect.&nbsp; I had to meet many of the old family
friends.&nbsp; It was really required of me, Aunt Lorena
explained, for there were a number present on this occasion who
had not been at my coming-out party.&nbsp; So, after the funeral,
I was introduced to them.</p>
<p>You understand, Carin, grandmother was not taken from the
house after the funeral.&nbsp; No, she was left lying up in that
splendid room, and downstairs the funeral guests were given some
refreshments&mdash;for most of them had come a long way, and many
were old&mdash;and then, at midnight, the old servants carried
the coffin to the great vault that stands in a grove near the
house, and Uncle David and Aunt Lorena and Keefe and I followed,
and she was <a name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>laid away with others of her family, my father among
the rest.</p>
<p>There are cypress trees and hemlocks round about this vault,
and they stood up black against the dark sky, swaying and
crying.&nbsp; Not one of us spoke a word, and the only sound was
the sobbing of the black people.&nbsp; I felt more like crying
than I ever had before in my life&mdash;yes, I wanted to sob
aloud and to call to grandmother to come back.&nbsp; Little
sweet, proud, loving, laughing grandmother!&nbsp; But I kept very
still.&nbsp; It seemed as if I could read Keefe&rsquo;s thoughts
and as if he were telling me to be quiet.&nbsp; So I said over
and over to myself the last line of a lovely poem I read the
other day.&nbsp; &ldquo;&lsquo;O waters of quiet, go
softly.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>After so long a life, one must be glad to rest.&nbsp; I found
out that night, Carin, how that death, like life, is sweet and
all in the course of things and nothing to be afraid of.</p>
<p>Going back to the house I told Keefe that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life is our comrade,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but death
is our mother, holding out kind hands to us when we are
tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When he left me he&mdash;he kissed me, Carin.&nbsp; On the
forehead.&nbsp; I shall always remember.</p>
<p><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>I did
not leave my room the next day.&nbsp; I wanted to think.&nbsp;
Old Semmy stayed with me.&nbsp; But I did not mind her.&nbsp; I
like old Semmy.&nbsp; She rocks to and fro like the trees and
seems to be waiting to give comfort when comfort is needed.&nbsp;
And that is like trees, too.&nbsp; After my little mama died I
used to wrap my arms about the trees up there on the
mountain-side and weep and weep, and they were very kind to
me&mdash;those great chestnuts and hemlocks.&nbsp; But now I am
thinking out many things.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t have written to
anyone save you.&nbsp; But soon I shall write dear Mother
McBirney and Annie Laurie.&nbsp; (I have, of course, sent them
word.)</p>
<p>Carin, tell me if you love me.</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Azalea</i>.</p>

<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right">Mallowbanks, January 30th.</p>
<p><i>Oh</i>, <i>Carin-girl</i>:</p>
<p>Other troubles have come to me&mdash;things I never dreamed
of.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t know how to meet them.&nbsp; They
aren&rsquo;t things like death, that just have to be accepted
with courage.&nbsp; No, they are things I have to decide
about.&nbsp; I have to make up my mind what is right and what is
<a name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
188</span>wrong.&nbsp; I never knew before that it could be hard
to do that.</p>
<p>This is the story: Two days after dear little grandmother was
buried, I was told that the family solicitor would be at the
house at three in the afternoon and that the will would be read,
and I was expected to be present.&nbsp; So I put on one of the
new black dresses that tell their own story, and when the time
came I went down to the library.&nbsp; Uncle and auntie were
there before me, and they introduced me to Mr. Lindsay, and then
when the servants had come, he read grandmother&rsquo;s will.</p>
<p>She was a rich woman, of course, but I had not guessed how
rich, and she gave bequests to Martha and James which would make
it unnecessary for them to work any more, with substantial
remembrances to the other servants, and a fine sum to the college
her sons attended, and then all of the rest she divided between
Uncle David and me.</p>
<p>Only&mdash;</p>
<p>Only I was not to have mine&mdash;except for a small
annuity&mdash;unless I married according to Uncle David&rsquo;s
wishes.</p>
<p>This, the will said, was not because of lack <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>of
affection for me or lack of confidence in me, but only because my
early associations were such, and I was of such an impulsive
nature, that I was in danger of doing something I would always
regret.&nbsp; So she placed me lovingly in her son&rsquo;s hands,
and expected me to defer to his judgment in all things.</p>
<p>Aunt Lorena looked down through all the reading of the will,
and when it was all over I tried to take her hand, but she
wouldn&rsquo;t let me, and it was Semmy who took my hand and led
me away to my room.&nbsp; I lay down on my lounge and thought and
thought.&nbsp; I could hear the winter wind shouting through the
pines, and outside the twilight was stormy and bleak.&nbsp; Semmy
wanted to build up a fire and to bring me tea there in my room,
but I did not want a fire and tea.&nbsp; There was only one thing
in the world that I wanted then, and I knew perfectly well what
it was.</p>
<p>It was Keefe O&rsquo;Connor.</p>
<p>And it was on account of him that grandmother had made that
will.&nbsp; She had seen that we cared for each other.&nbsp; She
had not wanted me to marry him.&nbsp; I knew then as well as when
Uncle David had told me, that she particularly <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>objected to
him&mdash;that is, that she particularly objected to having him
marry me.&nbsp; Not that he ever really asked me to, or that we
would marry for years and years.&nbsp; Yet&mdash;yet I know that
is what she meant when she made that will.</p>
<p>So now, Carin, I have learned my second great lesson this
week.&nbsp; The first was, that there could not be life without
death, and that if life is sweet, why so is death sweet too; and
the second is that life cannot be sweet without liberty.</p>
<p>Yes, I know it is an old, old truth, and that I ought to have
known it long ago.&nbsp; But to read a thing, or even to say it,
is very different from <i>realizing</i> it.</p>
<p>I lay there asking myself if freedom meant more to me than
anything else.&nbsp; And I decided that it did.&nbsp; It
wasn&rsquo;t Keefe, merely, that made me ask this question, or
decide in this way.&nbsp; It was the whole principle of the
thing.&nbsp; Should I sell my right to do as I thought
best&mdash;to do the thing that would bring me
happiness&mdash;for the sake of a fortune?</p>
<p>I did not go down to dinner.&nbsp; Semmy carried my excuses
for me.</p>
<p><a name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>Then,
a little later in the evening she came to ask if I would see Mr.
Keefe in the writing room.&nbsp; That was the room, you will
remember, where we all sat together the night grandmother told us
the story about Dorothy Bings.</p>
<p>I said I would go, and I brushed my hair and went on down the
stairs.&nbsp; Uncle David and Aunt Lorena were sitting in the
library and they saw me, and called out to know if I was feeling
better, and I told them quite frankly that I was not&mdash;thank
them, very much.</p>
<p>So, with them looking at me, I went on to the writing room,
and Keefe stood there by the door waiting for me, and we went in
and sat down there, one on each side of the table.&nbsp; There
was no firelight this time to cheer us.&nbsp; The room was so
chilly that it made my teeth chatter, but I did not really think
about that till afterward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Knox has told me,&rdquo; said Keefe as soon as we
were seated, &ldquo;about your grandmother&rsquo;s will.&nbsp; He
has said that he hopes I will not make the fulfillment of its
conditions difficult for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did he know that you were likely to?&rdquo; I
asked.</p>
<p><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
192</span>&ldquo;He could not very well help but know that,
Azalea.&nbsp; Anyone who has seen me with you must have known
that I loved you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you do?&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You do,
Keefe?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should I need to take the trouble to say it?&rdquo;
he demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t you known it from the
first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have hoped it&mdash;sometimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hoped it?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t
you heard me say it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once&mdash;only once.&nbsp; But I thought that might
have been an accident.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, Carin, what beautiful eyes he has!&nbsp; He took my hands
in his there across the table.&nbsp; We knew quite well that Aunt
Lorena could see us from where she sat, but we did not care at
all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you promise my uncle that you would not make it
hard for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&nbsp; I said if you wished it I would go
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forever?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all.&nbsp; For the present.&nbsp; I said I would
go away and give you a chance to make up your mind.&nbsp; Your
uncle and aunt wish to take you to Europe with them.&nbsp; They
want you <a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>to travel for a year or two.&nbsp; You will meet other
men, men whose lives and training will make them fitter
companions for you than I can ever be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keefe!&rdquo; I said sharply.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t
muddle up facts like that.&nbsp; Your early training was
propriety itself compared with mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, now you are a very rich woman.&nbsp; You
bear the name of an old and distinguished family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not half so distinguished as the
O&rsquo;Connors,&rdquo; I laughed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t
they kings in Ireland once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But my name is not even O&rsquo;Connor, as you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, whatever your name may be by rights,
Keefe&mdash;and at this moment I have forgotten what it
is&mdash;there is one word I cannot forget, and that is spelled
L-I-B-E-R-T-Y.&nbsp; In America we have always had a regard for
that little word.&nbsp; Perhaps we have preferred it to any in
the language.&nbsp; Hundreds of thousands of men have died for
it, and as many women have had broken hearts because of it.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;m not going to be behind them in my regard for it.&nbsp;
I&mdash;have you asked me?&nbsp; I love you, <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>Keefe.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d rather be one year with you than
twenty with anybody else.&nbsp; I shan&rsquo;t mean anything to
myself if I try to live my life away from you.&nbsp; I choose
you, Keefe.&nbsp; I set the fortune aside and choose
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Azalea,&rdquo; he said, breathing as if he had been
running, &ldquo;no, you mustn&rsquo;t choose yet.&nbsp; As your
uncle says, it isn&rsquo;t fair.&nbsp; I ought to go away&mdash;I
ought to give you a chance to clear your mind.&nbsp; It
isn&rsquo;t clear now&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I want you to stay,&rdquo; I broke in.</p>
<p>And just then Uncle David came to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, Azalea,&rdquo; he said quietly,
&ldquo;Mr. O&rsquo;Connor, having finished both of your
grandmother&rsquo;s portraits, will be leaving for the North
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but why to-morrow?&rdquo; I cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; he said, still in that quiet voice,
&ldquo;it is best so.&nbsp; I sympathize with you, my girl.&nbsp;
But believe me, it is best so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That is the way it stands, Carin.&nbsp; He has gone.&nbsp; It
is very quiet here in the house.&nbsp; Miss Delight Ravanel has
asked me to spend a week with her and I have accepted.</p>

195</span>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A FRIEND</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: right">Monrepos, January 28.</p>
<p><i>Carin</i>, <i>darling</i>:</p>
<p>Thank you for all your letters.&nbsp; You are very good to
me.&nbsp; No matter how careless I am about writing, you never
forget, you dear!&nbsp; And now I think I am to send you
congratulations because you are engaged to that fine Vance
Gr&eacute;vy.&nbsp; Truly, I think him one of the most
interesting young men I have ever known.&nbsp; Moreover, he looks
good, and true, and firm and enduring.&nbsp; Oh, little Carin, my
own yellow-headed one, be very happy with him!&nbsp; I send you a
thousand kisses and ten thousand good wishes, and I want you to
know that if ever, ever I can do anything for you, I want to be
allowed to do it.&nbsp; Please find something for me to do.&nbsp;
You must not be so happy that you will forget me.&nbsp; I have
always known there was a jealous streak in my disposition, and I
am feeling it right now.</p>
<p><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>You
say you have your ring?&nbsp; Your engagement ring!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s not like other engagement rings?&nbsp; How nice!&nbsp;
A pink pearl.&nbsp; Well, pearls suit you just as they do your
darling mother.</p>
<p>I am so glad that she and your father like your Vance.&nbsp;
Oh, fortunate girl!&nbsp; Always beautiful things happen to
you.&nbsp; That, of course, is just as it ought to be.&nbsp; I
hope they will keep right on happening to you all through
life.</p>
<p>But, once more, in your happiness, do not forget your
Azalea.&nbsp; For she is not very happy.&nbsp; No, though now she
has much money and some friends&mdash;you, always, and Barbara
and Annie Laurie, not to mention others&mdash;yet she is
sad.&nbsp; Things are wrong&mdash;quite wrong.</p>
<p>I told you I was coming over here to visit Miss Delight
Ravanel at her quaint old home, which she calls
&ldquo;Monrepos.&rdquo;&nbsp; Aunt Lorena was quite willing I
should come.&nbsp; She and I had a frank talk together, and now I
understand many things that I did not before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to ask you, Aunt Lorena,&rdquo; I said to
her, &ldquo;if you <i>truly</i> like me.&nbsp; You mustn&rsquo;t
be polite, please, because that would not help <a
name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 197</span>me at
all.&nbsp; You asked me to come here, and I came, and you have
been very kind, and I have done the best I could.&nbsp; But
lately there has been a change.&nbsp; You&mdash;you have not
looked at me quite the way you used.&nbsp; Or at any rate, the
understanding between us is not perfect.&nbsp; So let us speak
out and say what we really think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A silly woman would have been disagreeable, probably, at
having a young girl speak this way, but Aunt Lorena is not silly,
and she is not disagreeable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Azalea,&rdquo; she said quietly, &ldquo;I truly like
you.&nbsp; I am, indeed, happily surprised in you.&nbsp; I like
you better as a house companion than I thought I could like any
woman.&nbsp; For, to tell the truth, I am not a social
person.&nbsp; If I have not looked at you in quite the old way,
it is because I feel conscious of the complications that have
arisen.&nbsp; I do not believe, Azalea, in trying to influence
the life of another in the way that your grandmother has tried to
influence your life.&nbsp; It is not right.&nbsp; I believe that
everyone should be free in this world, so far as possible, and
your grandmother has taken your freedom away from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
198</span>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;she has.&nbsp; But
she meant to be wise and kind for me.&nbsp; I loved her, Aunt
Lorena, and I always shall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you willing to abide by the terms of her
will?&nbsp; Are you willing to marry the man your uncle approves
of&mdash;the man who will, according to your grandmother&rsquo;s
idea, bring credit to the family?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked so intense and sympathetic that I couldn&rsquo;t
help laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am willing to marry just one man,&rdquo; I found
courage to say.&nbsp; &ldquo;I hope uncle will approve of
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you mean Keefe O&rsquo;Connor,&rdquo; she said in
her high voice, &ldquo;you will see that your hopes are not
realized.&nbsp; Your uncle likes him very much personally, but
your grandmother did not.&nbsp; Or at least, she did not approve
of having him enter the Knox family.&nbsp; It was to keep him
from doing so that she made her will as she did.&nbsp; She told
your uncle that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carin, was it very bad of me to laugh again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;I shall have to let the
fortune go, Aunt Lorena.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She lifted both of her thin white hands in warning.</p>
<p><a name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
199</span>&ldquo;That is very easy for you to say, my dear, very
easy indeed.&nbsp; You are young and do not know the value of
money and of position and of an estate like this.&nbsp; It is the
feeling that you do not realize these things, that made it
necessary for your uncle and myself to ask Mr. O&rsquo;Connor
to&mdash;to absent himself&mdash;until you have had time to make
up your mind.&nbsp; We want you to travel and to see the
world.&nbsp; We want you to meet people and to have a chance to
compare this one with that.&nbsp; But when we insist upon all
this, it may seem to you as if we were opposing you and setting
ourselves against your happiness, whereas, above everything else,
we want to do what is for your best interest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She looked more solemn than ever.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going against your own heart, Auntie,&rdquo; I
told her.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is that which makes you seem so
changed.&nbsp; Oh, don&rsquo;t think about it at all.&nbsp; Just
treat me the way you did at first.&nbsp; Love me, love me!&nbsp;
Somehow, the other matter will straighten itself out.&nbsp; We
have troubles enough without bringing any on
ourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she wouldn&rsquo;t take the matter lightly.&nbsp; She
seemed very much depressed.&nbsp; Uncle was very <a
name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 200</span>sad, too,
partly on account of the loss of his mother, partly because he
was made to act the part of a &lsquo;stern guardian,&rsquo; when
it is not in keeping with his nature.&nbsp; I feel sure he tried
to dissuade grandmother from doing what she did, but he did not
succeed.&nbsp; I think, myself, that if people at Mallowbanks had
more to do they would be a great deal happier.</p>
<p>Well, anyway, I kept my promise to my nice twenty-seventh
cousin, Miss Ravanel, and came away over to her, and was put in a
quaint, bare, sunny room, and here I have been for almost a
week.&nbsp; My chocolate is sent up to my bed in the morning;
Miss Ravanel does not appear until ten.&nbsp; Then we meet in the
morning room and she embroiders while I read &ldquo;Lorna
Doone&rdquo; to her.&nbsp; She has been in England in the Lorna
Doone country, and she interrupts the reading to tell me about
what she has seen.&nbsp; It is very interesting.&nbsp; But, Oh,
Carin, it is as if I were listening to something afar off, and as
if the bright fire burning in the grate, the pale sunshine on the
pines, the little room with its fantastic chintz, were all a
dream.</p>
<p>It does not seem real at all to me.&nbsp; Is it because I am
always thinking of something else?</p>
<p><a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>Did I
do well, Carin, to give up my life with Mother McBirney, my
little busy, useful, struggling life, and to come here among my
relatives, who are, after all, strangers?&nbsp; Yes, yes, I know
that for a time I felt at ease with them, that to be among my own
people brought me great delight.&nbsp; But now, suddenly, I seem
useless and stripped of all that made life rich.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp;
*&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *&nbsp; *</p>
<p>Carin, I have just been reading this over, and I never read
anything more dismal.&nbsp; You remember that song of Jean
Ingelow&rsquo;s where the dove sat on the mast and mourned and
mourned and mourned.&nbsp; Well, I sound precisely like that
ridiculous dove.</p>
<p>I know if you were here you would give me a piece of your
mind.&nbsp; So would Keefe.&nbsp; So would Annie Laurie.&nbsp;
Actually I am glad none of you is here.&nbsp; Mercy me, how you
would scold me!</p>
<p>It has occurred to me during the last minute and a half that I
haven&rsquo;t been treating my tremendously nice little hostess
very well.&nbsp; And how good she has been to me!</p>
<p>I am going to reform.&nbsp; I shall ask her if <a
name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>she&rsquo;ll not go walking&mdash;she loves to
walk&mdash;and I shall suggest visiting old Mrs. Treadway, whom
Miss Ravanel likes to look after.</p>
<p>Carin, forgive me for being such a dolorous creature.&nbsp;
And you so happy, too!&nbsp; I wanted to do something for you,
and I go and throw cold water on your sparkling day with a
sighing, moaning letter.&nbsp; Shame on me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>I love you</i>,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Azalea</i>.</p>

<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right">Monrepos, February 1st.</p>
<p><i>Carin girl</i>:</p>
<p>So you are to be at Lee for the spring vacation.&nbsp; What
fun!&nbsp; Of course I shall try to get there.&nbsp; I feel as if
I must see you.&nbsp; And do you really mean to tell me that you
want me to go to Europe with you, Carin?&nbsp; How wonderful that
would be.&nbsp; But I couldn&rsquo;t, could I?&nbsp; If I go at
all I must go with Uncle David and Aunt Lorena.&nbsp; So
that&rsquo;s settled.</p>
<p>What do you think Miss Ravanel and I have been doing?&nbsp;
Making dresses.&nbsp; She needed some and there didn&rsquo;t seem
to be anybody at hand to make them, and so I said to please let
<a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>me
try.&nbsp; At first she thought I would make a botch of
them.&nbsp; But not at all.&nbsp; Mother McBirney taught me to be
very particular, and I have a sort of a &ldquo;touch&rdquo; as
you and Annie Laurie always said.&nbsp; The dresses, which are
for spring, are really very nice.&nbsp; She said she never had
any that really suited her so well.</p>
<p>While we sewed, she told me many things about her life.&nbsp;
I was quite right; she did love my Uncle David when she was a
girl and he was a young man, but when Aunt Lorena came back from
boarding school, he fell terribly in love with her and went to
Miss Ravanel and told her, and she bade him do whatever his heart
prompted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not going to hate me, are you,
Delight?&rdquo; he asked her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hate you?&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why should I
hate you?&nbsp; I want you to be very happy and mean to be happy
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will marry someone much more worthy of you than I
am,&rdquo; he assured her.&nbsp; She said that was as might
be.&nbsp; She hoped she would love someone again.&nbsp; But she
never did, Carin.&nbsp; All of her life she has had to see her
kin leaving her, either to go to some other part <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>of the
country, or into the family vault, and never once has she met
anyone she could care for.&nbsp; But she says she has been quite
happy after all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love life,&rdquo; she told me.&nbsp; &ldquo;I like to
watch the seasons roll around, and I enjoy each one as it
comes.&nbsp; I am never tired of walking about my woods and my
garden, and it amuses me to care for my old house.&nbsp; I enjoy
my books, my music and my thoughts.&nbsp; Sometimes I am glad
that I never married.&nbsp; I have fallen into very quiet ways,
and it would disturb me to have anyone about, except someone like
yourself, Azalea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When I see her, so shy and dainty and content, going about her
little duties and hospitalities, I am glad, too, that she did not
marry.&nbsp; She is like a little domestic nun.&nbsp; I like her
the way she is.</p>
<p>Uncle and Aunt Lorena called this morning to ask me when I was
coming home, and I told them I would come any time they liked,
and they wanted me to go with them at once, but Miss Ravanel
begged that I might stay over one Sunday more.&nbsp; She wants to
teach me to make Washington pie, and we both want to <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>finish
&ldquo;Lorna Doone.&rdquo;&nbsp; So I am staying.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
much happier.&nbsp; This is just a line to tell you.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Your own</i></p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Azalea</i>.</p>

<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right">Mallowbanks, February 10.</p>
<p><i>Dearest Carin</i>:</p>
<p>We are getting ready to go to England.&nbsp; Aunt Lorena is
having a charming outfit made for me.&nbsp; Now that she and I
really understand each other, we are getting along together
beautifully.&nbsp; You see, she is a frank, straight-forward,
fair-minded woman and she couldn&rsquo;t enjoy herself while she
thought I was not being fairly treated.&nbsp; But now that I know
everything, and that she sees I have the courage to make my
choice, she feels better about it all.</p>
<p>I wish you could see my new clothes.&nbsp; They are
delightful, and so becoming!&nbsp; They are very practical
too.&nbsp; We are not going to take quantities of things, because
it would only bother us.&nbsp; But I have my traveling suit of
Scotch cloth in a small blue and green plaid, and a hat of blue
silk braid trimmed with green, and a steamer rug and coat that
look <a name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
206</span>well with it; and then two little silks for dinner,
nights when we are stopping at any rather fashionable
places&mdash;one of old rose, and the other of dove color.&nbsp;
The pink will be for gay moods, the dove color for pensive
ones.&nbsp; Then there is my street suit of tan with shoes and
gloves to suit, and the cleverest hat you ever saw, with two big
tawny chrysanthemums on it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t seem to be very
good at describing clothes, but really, as I said at the
beginning, these things are charming.</p>
<p>Then to think of seeing England!&nbsp; Me, Azalea!&nbsp; I
don&rsquo;t believe it.&nbsp; I cannot bring myself to see that
it can possibly be true.</p>
<p>Carin, that reminds me: Why don&rsquo;t you ask Annie Laurie
to go abroad with you?&nbsp; Do you know, I think she would do
it.&nbsp; I remember hearing your mother say to her, years and
years ago, that some day she and Annie Laurie would be together
in Europe, listening to great music.&nbsp; And why not?&nbsp;
Annie Laurie could easily afford it.&nbsp; Sam Disbrow is through
with school now, and he could look after Annie Laurie&rsquo;s
dairy.&nbsp; Propose it, do.&nbsp; Perhaps we could all meet over
there.</p>
<p>I must run down to see Mother McBirney <a
name="page207"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 207</span>before I
go.&nbsp; Father McBirney is almost well and hopes to reach home
in March to do the plowing.&nbsp; He will get someone to help him
of course, for Jim is to stay on at school.&nbsp; I have placed a
certain sum in the bank for Jim&mdash;enough to last him till he
has graduated if he is careful.&nbsp; And Jim <i>is</i>
careful.&nbsp; I made up my mind that whatever happened, I was
going to see that Jim got what he wanted in the way of an
education.&nbsp; He really is wonderfully bright and learns so
fast that I don&rsquo;t see how he can remember all that he crams
into his head.</p>
<p>Keefe doesn&rsquo;t write.&nbsp; That was a part of the
bargain that he made with Uncle David&mdash;that he was not to
write.</p>
<p>But I write to him.</p>
<p>Is that terribly bold?</p>
<p>But you wouldn&rsquo;t think so if you could see the
letters.&nbsp; Anyway, sometimes they aren&rsquo;t letters.&nbsp;
They are just envelopes with little poems in them that I find in
the magazines or newspapers and the like.&nbsp; Of course,
sometimes I write a poem, too.&nbsp; About daffodils, you know,
or sunsets, or rainy days.&nbsp; Never anything
sentimental.&nbsp; Not at all.&nbsp; Or personal.&nbsp; I
wouldn&rsquo;t be personal.&nbsp; I merely <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>remind
Keefe that I am alive.&nbsp; A couple of violets in a blank sheet
of paper will do that nicely.&nbsp; Aunt Lorena knows.&nbsp; She
doesn&rsquo;t approve.&nbsp; Not quite, that is.&nbsp; She says
it is foolish.&nbsp; So since then I&rsquo;ve only been sending
little drawings&mdash;pictures of people who call, and one of the
Gr&eacute;vy&rsquo;s parrot, and another of some geese I saw
flying north.&nbsp; They are such bad drawings that they are
quite sure to annoy Keefe.&nbsp; I pointed out their badness to
Aunt Lorena.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be a good idea to annoy him?&rdquo; I
asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now just look at this sketch of a cat which I
mean to send him.&nbsp; That cat will make him furious.&nbsp; I
tried to foreshorten it, but I seem to have performed a surgical
operation on it instead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have you arrested for cruelty to
animals,&rdquo; she agreed.&nbsp; &ldquo;But really, Azalea, I
wish you would keep perfectly silent.&nbsp; This young man does
not write to you.&nbsp; Are you doing what is
dignified?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt Lorena,&rdquo; I said, shaking my finger at her,
&ldquo;my own private opinion is that he is writing to me every
night of his life, and filing the letters away for future
reference.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>Aunt
Lorena lifted her eyebrows very, very high.&nbsp; I smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you laughing at, Azalea?&rdquo; she asked
sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At your Gothic eyebrows, dearest Auntie,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; Then I kissed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me to be too dignified,&rdquo; I
begged.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only Azalea.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Azalea Knox is a very pleasing and interesting young
woman of a good deal of importance in the world, if she would
only realize it,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>I looked at her a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not so very, very happy,&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; The tears came in her eyes, and her eyebrows were not
pointed at all.&nbsp; Really, Aunt Lorena is a dear.&nbsp; You
just have to break through her crust.&nbsp; The only trouble is
that the crust grows over, and you have to keep breaking
through.&nbsp; It makes you feel a little like an Eskimo,
fishing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am truly sorry,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I
think if she is a really obedient and patient girl that some day
she will be very happy, and that she will thank the friends who
now seem to her to be afflicting her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t say anything for a few minutes.</p>
<p><a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>Then
I ventured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you really think I ought not to send anything to
Keefe?&nbsp; Not even this terrible drawing of a cat?&nbsp; Not
even to make him laugh and&mdash;and hold me in
contempt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed at that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for any reason at all,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, Aunt Lorena, let me send word just once
more&mdash;only once.&nbsp; It will be the end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will never direct another envelope of any sort to him
till he writes to me.&nbsp; If he has given his word, he will not
do that until&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until?&rdquo; Her eyebrows were Gothic arches
again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until we find, beyond all question, that we cannot live
apart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Piffle,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;One can live
without anyone.&nbsp; It is a mere question of making up
one&rsquo;s mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I sent Keefe the terrible little picture of the cat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keefe,&rdquo; I wrote him, &ldquo;please excuse me for
being a bold-faced minx.&nbsp; I must be one, or I wouldn&rsquo;t
have sent you poems and violets and things.&nbsp; Kindly observe
this drawing of a cat.&nbsp; <a name="page211"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 211</span>It is a cat, I don&rsquo;t care what
you say.&nbsp; She looks as I feel, somewhat cramped.&nbsp; But
she is a good cat, and I am a good, obedient girl.&nbsp; I shall
waste no more stamps on you.&nbsp; I am going to England, and I
am commanded to be very happy.&nbsp; So, since I am obedient,
pray think of me as being not only happy but gay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I signed my name to it&mdash;just
&ldquo;Azalea&rdquo;&mdash;and sent it off.&nbsp; Now I shall
write no more.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Farewell</i>,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Azalea</i>.</p>
<p>P.S.&nbsp; I wish you could see my traveling veil.&nbsp; It
looks like a peacock&rsquo;s breast.&nbsp; Clothes are nice,
aren&rsquo;t they?&nbsp; I never realized before how nice they
are.</p>

<p><i>Carin</i>, <i>my dear</i>:</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been writing to you because I haven&rsquo;t
thought best.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t want to put myself on
record.&nbsp; I have been keeping my thoughts to myself, and I
never could have done that successfully if I had been gossiping
to you, could I?&nbsp; Anyway, I knew you were particularly happy
and busy.&nbsp; You were down to Lee for the spring vacation I
suppose and opened up the Shoals, and had your own Vance
Gr&eacute;vy there, and delightful people to meet him and all
that.&nbsp; Then you went back to Vassar.&nbsp; And in two months
you will be graduating, and then you and your people will come
over to Europe, bringing, I hope, Annie Laurie with you.&nbsp; I
believe you agreed with me that it would be a fine thing for both
of you if she would join you.</p>

for me, I have been living in two worlds at once: this mellow,
storied world of England, and my own little secret world of
memories and dreams.&nbsp; We have had unusual opportunities for
seeing the real English life.&nbsp; Both Aunt Lorena and Uncle
David have relatives and friends here, and we have been
entertained in a number of homes very graciously indeed.</p>
<p>I like the English people.&nbsp; They are not always fizzing
and bubbling like Americans.&nbsp; There is a repose about them
and a quietness of character that rests me.&nbsp; It even rests
me from my fizzly and bubbly self.</p>
<p>But deep down, Carin, beneath all the effervescence, there is
something very quiet and peaceful in me.&nbsp; When I am alone,
after the day of sight-seeing and chattering and laughing and
admiring, I and this Still Soul of mine sit down together and
commune.</p>
<p>Then I am no longer foolish.&nbsp; I am something
that&mdash;how shall I put it?&nbsp; Something that forever
strives!&nbsp; Is that it?&nbsp; I want to do well with my little
life, Carin.&nbsp; I want to spin my silver web very beautifully,
so that when I am old, and the web is all but done, I can look it
over and be satisfied with it.</p>
<p><a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>I
have been keeping a diary, and in it are descriptions of all the
places I have seen and the record of what I have done each
day.&nbsp; When we get together again I shall show this to you,
and then you can read all about what has been happening to
me.&nbsp; But having written those descriptions once, I
don&rsquo;t at all feel like doing it again.</p>
<p>Anyway, what is the use?&nbsp; You have seen all of these
places.&nbsp; They were an old story to you before I so much as
thought of coming over here.&nbsp; But I do love London!&nbsp;
Uncle and auntie have seen it before, and they get tired of
wandering, so I am put in the care of an excellent Englishwoman
who knows everything, apparently, and who is paid to pass on as
much of her information to me as she possibly can.&nbsp; Her
voice is very monotonous, unfortunately, so that I find myself
nodding right on the busses, in the midst of her discourses, and
I am afraid I am not learning one-tenth of what I ought.</p>
<p>But at odd moments I catch sight of things that enchant
me.</p>
<p>The other day she and I were going to the Tate Gallery
together, and after leaving the <a name="page215"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 215</span>bus we came out on the Embankment by
means of a curious little street, and suddenly, Carin, we were
face to face with some sort of a ship wrecking place.&nbsp; It
looked as if it had been there for hundreds of years.&nbsp; The
great enclosure was heaped up with parts of ships, with the giant
beams and the masts, and hulls, and, more interesting than all
the rest, with countless figureheads.</p>
<p>Of course I knew that nearly every ship carries its figure at
its bow.&nbsp; It was for such a purpose that the beautiful
<i>Victory of Samothrace</i> was built, wasn&rsquo;t it?&nbsp;
But not until I had seen these great wooden creatures, made to
represent Neptune and Boreas and Victory and Venus and mermaids
and angels, and heaven knows what, did I have any idea what care
the ship builders put on these figures.</p>
<p>Miss Sheepshanks, my chaperon, of course didn&rsquo;t want me
to stop to look at them.&nbsp; She was telling about the pictures
waiting for us at the gallery, and reminding me of the closing
hour, et cetera, et cetera, but for once I was determined to have
my way.&nbsp; So I pleaded with her until she allowed me to go
in.&nbsp; There was a white-headed old man in charge, whose face
<a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 216</span>simply
shone when I told him I would like to walk around and look at his
figureheads.&nbsp; So we went side by side, Miss Sheepshanks
following, looking as grieved as she could, and that darling old
man told me stories about the ships these figures had come
from.</p>
<p>I swear to you they literally smelled of the seven seas!&nbsp;
Ah, such strange, weird creatures as some of them were, and their
battered forms told their own story of the storms they had
weathered and the sights they had seen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a heap of stories you must know,&rdquo; I said to
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stories?&rdquo; he repeated looking at me with his old,
bright eyes.&nbsp; &ldquo;Every ship could tell as many stories
as would make an Arabian Nights.&nbsp; If I started in, miss,
telling the stories I know, I should never be done till the day
of my death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do wish I lived near here,&rdquo; I couldn&rsquo;t
help saying; &ldquo;then I could come over and listen when you
were not busy.&nbsp; That is, if you would be willing to tell
some of your stories to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would put life into my old age,&rdquo; he said
earnestly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Now, miss, I&rsquo;m something of a <a
name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>reader in
my way.&nbsp; There is a library near that I get my books from,
for thripence a day.&nbsp; Not bad, is it?&nbsp; Even a poor man
can afford that, miss.&nbsp; But when I read the tales, I think
to myself: &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t some of you writing fellows
come around here and ask the old man a few questions?&nbsp; He
could tell you tales of the salt seas that would make men&rsquo;s
hair bristle.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Sheepshanks seemed to think this was terribly strong
language for me to hear, and she tried to hasten me away, but I
wouldn&rsquo;t go till I had told him the story of Samuel Bings
and had a wonderful story from him in return.&nbsp; I noted it
all down in my diary, and you shall read that, too.&nbsp; We went
to the Gallery after that, and saw some beautiful pictures, but I
am such a silly that my mind kept going back to that old man and
the stories he could tell, and when we came out I insisted on
going by his place again, and we could see him inside his little
office, making his own tea.&nbsp; So the next day, without
telling anyone, I sent him a pound of tea in a queer Chinese
cannister, just saying it was from the girl who liked
stories.</p>
<p><a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>Well,
well, I shan&rsquo;t see him again.&nbsp; They hedge me around in
every way.&nbsp; A maid or a chaperon must be with me every
minute.&nbsp; How I wish I were free to go about and get
acquainted with people!&nbsp; They&mdash;I mean Aunt Lorena and
all the powers of propriety&mdash;seem to think that if I did I
would have some awful mishap.&nbsp; But do you know, Carin, I
don&rsquo;t think that would be the case.&nbsp; I feel as if
right at my hand there may be someone I ought to be knowing and
who ought to be knowing me.</p>
<p>That reminds me of what I so long dreamed of doing down in
Lee.&nbsp; Not only was I going to take charge of the Industries
and help the mountain people as they never were helped before,
but I was going to have a home which should be open to every
passer-by.&nbsp; Before it was to be a spring of water&mdash;I
know the very spring&mdash;where people could stop for a cold
drink, and beside the spring would be seats where they could
rest.&nbsp; Not far down the road there would be a trough for
horses and another for dogs; and in my cupboard would always be
something for whomever was hungry.&nbsp; It would not matter how
poor or soiled or strange any passer-by might be, he or she
should <a name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
219</span>come in and sit beside my hearth and have of my
best.&nbsp; Even very wicked people could come in.&nbsp; And men
on the chain gang, mending the road&mdash;how I would like to
take them out a fine dinner and let them know I believed in
them.&nbsp; Perhaps they would let me eat with them, and then
maybe I could find out what they were really thinking.</p>
<p>Carin, that is what I want more than anything, I believe, to
know what other people are really thinking.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t
tell you how it interests, nay, absorbs me!</p>
<p>But in the sort of life that I lead now, no one speaks out and
says what he thinks.&nbsp; We are endlessly polite.&nbsp; We all
say the same thing.&nbsp; We all do the same things.&nbsp; At
times, it is true, I see someone looking at me with the eyes of
true friendship, but we are parted by the people about us, and we
do not really become acquainted.&nbsp; So I am very lonely, in
spite of all that is interesting and beautiful about me, and I
wish you and I and Annie Laurie were sitting together up in your
little studio-room, with the world far from us, and just we three
opening our hearts to each other.</p>
<p>I have been out to-day selecting some <a
name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 220</span>presents
for friends back at home, and I enjoyed that very much.&nbsp; Do
you know, I couldn&rsquo;t resist getting something for those two
lonely women, the Wixons, up on Hebron mountain&mdash;the ones
whose soup I ate uninvited.&nbsp; If ever I get back to Lee, I
shall ride up and get acquainted with those women.&nbsp;
Isn&rsquo;t it curious how people draw you and draw you, even
people you have never met, but know only by report?&nbsp; As for
those you do know, they can draw you half around the world.&nbsp;
Yes, out of the millions and millions of human beings on this old
globe, there will be but two or three, perhaps, who are verily
your own, and those you must have.</p>
<p>A young man called on uncle yesterday, bearing a letter of
introduction.&nbsp; He lives, I believe, in Baltimore, and his
name is Gerald Hargreaves.&nbsp; His father was a friend of
uncle&rsquo;s, and some mutual friend who knew that uncle was
over here, gave him the letter.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t think he was
very keen about presenting it, but we are glad he did, for he
seems a delightful young man.&nbsp; Uncle David took to him at
once, and so, for the matter of that, did Aunt Lorena and
I.&nbsp; He is an athletic young person <a
name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>with a
general blond appearance and a nice voice.&nbsp; He seems modest,
too, and genial.&nbsp; He finished college last year and has been
traveling around Europe, but he means to go back home soon and
settle down.&nbsp; He is to follow the custom of his family and
go into the railroad business.&nbsp; Naturally, we talked about
railroads a good deal, and the methods of home and foreign
travel.&nbsp; He turned to me and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your favorite means of travel, Miss
Knox?&rdquo;&nbsp; And before I thought how it would sound I
replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nag travel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aunt Lorena looked rather embarrassed, but Uncle David
roared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My niece is a true Southern mountaineer,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;and she isn&rsquo;t afraid of anything in the way of
horseflesh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Though I have been thrown,&rdquo; I admitted, looking
at Uncle David and thinking of the fateful day that Paprika
scampered up the mountain away from Uncle David&rsquo;s
machine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortunately,&rdquo; said Uncle David, and left the
young man to figure out what that might mean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you think it was fortunate, dear,&rdquo;
<a name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>I
whispered to him.&nbsp; He gave my hand a little squeeze under
the table&mdash;we were at tea&mdash;and I felt my heart warm
up.&nbsp; When I think that Uncle David loves me it brightens up
everything; but he is a quiet man and does not say much.&nbsp; He
likes to go his own way and amuse himself after his own fashion,
and he doesn&rsquo;t wish to be bothered all of the time by
paying attention to those around him.&nbsp; As for Aunt Lorena,
she takes life as it comes.&nbsp; She is very philosophical and
patient and proud, and she sinks back into her easy feminine
place and doesn&rsquo;t question anything.&nbsp; The trouble with
me is that I&rsquo;m nearly bursting with questions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought I to do this?&nbsp; Ought I to think that?&nbsp;
Am I making the most of my opportunities?&nbsp; Am I being
myself, Azalea, or am I imitating these others?&nbsp; Am I of any
use or am I just consuming good oxygen and nice food and getting
in the way generally?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s how I keep at it.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t seem to be
able to give myself any rest, but must always be badgering myself
like that.</p>
<p>We are all going to the theater to-night to see &ldquo;A
Winter&rsquo;s Tale.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Hargreaves goes <a
name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 223</span>with
us.&nbsp; I shall wear my white silk and my peach-blow silk
jacket.&nbsp; They are charming together.&nbsp; I have a fillet
of silver wheat for my hair.&nbsp; Yesterday I sewed little
perfume bags&mdash;with violet powder in them&mdash;in all of my
frocks.&nbsp; Violet is the pleasantest of the perfumes, I
think.&nbsp; Though Aunt Lorena uses white rose.&nbsp; What is
your favorite, Carin?&nbsp; I have forgotten.&nbsp; Or perhaps
when you and I saw each other, I was not thinking much about
perfumes.</p>
<p>Well, now I think about all such things.&nbsp; I have learned
to approve of certain makes of gloves and to disapprove of
others.&nbsp; I know what sort of laces an unmarried girl should
wear, and what ones should be reserved for married ladies.&nbsp;
I know&mdash;Oh, I know a thousand things!&nbsp; I hope little
madam grandmother would approve of me.&nbsp; Though she is gone,
I still try to please her.&nbsp; Sometimes, when I have tried
particularly hard to be polite and gay the way she would like me
to be, I fancy I feel her little jeweled hand on my head and that
I hear her say:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are doing very well indeed, my dear.&nbsp; Really,
I could ask nothing more of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>What
a pity grandmother could not have passed on her charm as well as
her money to me!</p>
<p>But I am thankful for the money, though money can never play a
tremendously large part in my life, because it is so much less
interesting than some other things.&nbsp; But as I said, I have
been out shopping, and you ought to see what I bought Annie
Laurie&mdash;a picture of the sea that I know she will
love.&nbsp; And I got a watch for Paralee Panther&mdash;a wrist
watch.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s really a school-teacher at last, as I
think I told you, so the watch will be useful.&nbsp; But I have
presents for everybody.&nbsp; Buying these things for the people
dear to me keeps me from feeling homesick.</p>
<p>Good night, Carin.&nbsp; It is time to dress for dinner.&nbsp;
And after that comes the theater, and I am glad.&nbsp; I do love
the theater!&nbsp; And best of all I enjoy the moment when the
curtain begins to rise.&nbsp; It is such a throbbing
moment.&nbsp; What will one see?&nbsp; What story is to be
told?&nbsp; Will one forget that it is a play and believe it all
to be true?&nbsp; Will one like life better for having seen
it?&nbsp; Will one go out dancing or weeping?</p>
<p><a name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>Oh,
it&rsquo;s a great moment when the curtain begins to rise.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">Como, August 13.</p>
<p><i>Oh</i>, <i>my dear neglected friend</i>:</p>
<p>I meant to have sent you a dozen letters between my last one
and this, but we have been so busy that I simply could not
write.&nbsp; I thought I was a particularly strong person, but I
give you my word, Carin, that at the end of a day of sight-seeing
I am glad to eat my dinner and slip into my bed.&nbsp; However,
there is usually something required of me between the eating of
the dinner and the seeking of my couch, for we have been
entertaining much, and have been much entertained.</p>
<p>We left London late in May and sailed to Genoa, and since then
we have been seeing Italy.&nbsp; As it chanced, Aunt Lorena fell
in with some old friends who have been living for years near
Fiesole, and they decided to journey with us.&nbsp; This has
given us the entr&eacute;e to many homes which we should
otherwise not have seen, and it has all been very gay and
diverting.</p>
<p><a name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>Never
have I loved any place as I do Italy.&nbsp; Such beauty, such
pathos!&nbsp; I cannot express all I feel, though my diary shall
some day show you that I have tried.&nbsp; But more of that some
other time, dear girl.&nbsp; I insist that we must be together
this winter for a while.&nbsp; Am I right in thinking you will go
home for the winter, and that you are to have the delicious
experience of preparing your trousseau there in your own dear old
home?&nbsp; I want to help with that.&nbsp; I have hunted out a
few little things that may find a place in it, and I want to use
my needle in your service.</p>
<p>Mr. Hargreaves has been everywhere with us.&nbsp; I thought it
odd of him to accompany us to Venice and to Rome, since he had
been in both places only a few months ago.&nbsp; But it was his
affair.&nbsp; There was nothing to keep him from visiting both
places again if he chose.&nbsp; Of course he has added to my
pleasure, being nearer my age than any of the others.&nbsp; Uncle
and Aunt Lorena appear to have much satisfaction from his
presence, too.&nbsp; They like him immensely and talk about him a
great deal.&nbsp; They think him brilliant, but I am not sure
that I do.&nbsp; His mind clings too long to one <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
227</span>subject.&nbsp; I like a little more agility.&nbsp;
Weren&rsquo;t you always amused at the way the minds of Mary
Cecily and her brother danced from subject to subject?&nbsp; It
was touch and go with them.&nbsp; All they needed was half a
sentence&mdash;they understood the rest before it was spoken.</p>
<p>I think myself that no one ought to visit Venice except with
her own true love.&nbsp; To float over those moonlit canals to
the sound of music, between those regal, slumbering palaces in
the company of mere casual acquaintances or elderly relatives is
too much to ask of anyone.</p>
<p>We four, uncle, auntie, Mr. Hargreaves and I, were much in the
gondolas, going now here, now there, seeing strange old things
and dreaming old dreams.&nbsp; Not at all, I am sure, because he
cares for me, but just because the surroundings were too much for
him, Mr. Hargreaves was inclined to be&mdash;well, a trifle
sentimental.&nbsp; But I couldn&rsquo;t endure that.&nbsp; Having
the wrong man make love is worse than going without&mdash;Oh,
much!&nbsp; But I didn&rsquo;t want to hurt his feelings, so I
took it all as a joke, and told him to hold Aunt Lorena&rsquo;s
hand; that she was a much more sentimental person than I.</p>
<p><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>He
sent me flowers every morning, but I wouldn&rsquo;t keep
them.&nbsp; There was a sweet English girl there who was not
well, and I made her take most of them.&nbsp; The rest I threw in
the canal&mdash;not as an insult to the flowers or their giver,
but because, when I was gondola riding, it gave me pleasure to
throw out a rose now and then and see it drift with the
tide.&nbsp; Aunt Lorena wasn&rsquo;t sure that I was being kind
to her friend, but I was, really.&nbsp; It wouldn&rsquo;t have
been at all kind to let him think I cared when I didn&rsquo;t,
would it, dear?</p>
<p>We met a bright young fellow the other day who had studied at
the Academy of Design with Keefe, and he said he thought Keefe
had decided to go into landscape work instead of portraits, after
all, which seems rather odd considering what a success he was
making with portraits.&nbsp; I said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you think he changed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s hard to say,&rdquo; he answered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Keefe doesn&rsquo;t seem the fellow he used to be.&nbsp;
You remember how jolly he was, and how he loved company?&nbsp; It
is different with him now.&nbsp; He keeps much to himself and
works beyond all reason.&nbsp; I believe in being industrious,
but <a name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
229</span>there&rsquo;s no use in being a fanatic about
work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But is he well?&nbsp; Does he look as he
used?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly I remembered that he had come south years ago because
his lungs were not strong, and I turned cold at the thought that
the trouble that had threatened him, might really have come back
and fastened itself on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he looks well enough,&rdquo; the young man
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only a little wild and queer.&nbsp; But
O&rsquo;Connor is queer, don&rsquo;t you think so?&nbsp; A sign
of genius, no doubt.&nbsp; He had a strange bringing up,
hadn&rsquo;t he?&nbsp; He&rsquo;s a gentleman, of course; any one
can see that; but he&rsquo;s rather adventurous too; a strange
mixture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what to say.&nbsp; I felt I should betray
myself if I talked about him any longer, so I only ventured:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has a charming sister.&nbsp; She is one of my best
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; said the young man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, I
hear O&rsquo;Connor is putting up a studio somewhere in the Blue
Ridge and that he means to try his hand at interpreting the
mountains, but I think myself, he had better have stuck to
portraits.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>&ldquo;Very likely,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>I have heard many conversations during the last few weeks,
Carin, but that is the only one I remember.</p>
<p>How good to be able to write you like this!&nbsp; I am so
tired of keeping things to myself.&nbsp; We shall be starting for
home some time in October, I believe.&nbsp; I shall hope to write
you, but if I do not, think of me still, in spite of all
silences, as</p>

<span class="GutSmall">CROSSROADS</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: right">Mallowbanks, November 15.</p>
<p><i>Carin</i>, <i>always best and dearest</i>:</p>
<p>Here I am, back again.&nbsp; Back from England, back from
Italy.&nbsp; The first seemed to me like the great Mother of my
Mind; the second like the eternal Mother of my Soul.&nbsp;
Always, as long as I live, I shall dream of them.</p>
<p>And this is a good place for dreaming.&nbsp; Indeed, there is
little else to do here.&nbsp; The old house lies in perpetual
quiet.&nbsp; The garden is dead again.&nbsp; You will remember
that I have only seen it when it was dead.&nbsp; I did not mean
to do it, but by accident, when I was walking in it, I came on
the little pool where my darling grandmother was drowned, and
there were the three swans, aimlessly floating about, just as
they did that terrible twilight.</p>
<p>But I don&rsquo;t know that the swans go about <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>any more
aimlessly than we do here in the house.&nbsp; There is very
little coming and going, for we are in mourning.&nbsp; Uncle does
not take a daily paper.&nbsp; He says it frets him and that there
is really no use.&nbsp; He says he can get all the essentials
from the <i>Weekly Eyrie</i>.&nbsp; And so, I suppose, he
can.&nbsp; But all this helps to keep us very quiet.&nbsp; It is
as if we lived in an ivory tower.&nbsp; We might be enchanted, so
little do we know of other lives than our own.</p>
<p>I said something like this to Aunt Lorena, and she
replied:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only the reaction after your journey.&nbsp; A
person is likely to feel rather let down on first coming home
from a tour.&nbsp; Can you not amuse yourself, Azalea, thinking
over the places you have seen?&nbsp; Oughtn&rsquo;t you to be
taking up your French again?&nbsp; I think I had better arrange
for Monsieur Angier to come from Charleston once a week to teach
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thanked her, and went away to my room, presumably to do as
she recommended and &ldquo;think.&rdquo;&nbsp; But thinking is
not living, Carin, and I want to live.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t want
to remember.&nbsp; I want to do!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m tired of having
other people do things for me; I&rsquo;m tired of being treated
as <a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>if I
were better than other people; I&rsquo;m tired of being cheated
of my youth by being made to act as if I were seventy.</p>
<p>Yes, that is what it amounts to.&nbsp; I am being cheated of
my youth.&nbsp; I am so strong and well, so restless and full of
energy that I nearly expire in this soft house, where everyone
goes quietly, and where we must not even pass things at the table
lest we break rules.</p>
<p>Carin, I want to &ldquo;reach&rdquo; for the bread and to eat
it with mountain honey, and I&rsquo;m starving for one of Ma
McBirney&rsquo;s corn cakes, and I&rsquo;d like better than
anything to have some bacon and eggs for <i>dinner</i>&mdash;with
just barely enough to go around.</p>
<p>I tell you, I&rsquo;m eating too much, I&rsquo;m sleeping too
much.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m moping too much!&nbsp; I wish I could get
on Paprika&rsquo;s back and go scurrying down the valley,
whooping as I go.</p>
<p>Well, let&rsquo;s talk of something else.</p>
<p>You say that Mrs. Kitchell is really going to marry the feed
store man.&nbsp; That is fine.&nbsp; I must think what to send
her for a wedding present.&nbsp; I shall make it something quite
gorgeous&mdash;nothing sensible at all.&nbsp; She has had so much
good sense in her life that she must <a name="page234"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 234</span>be nearly dead of it.&nbsp; I think
I&rsquo;ll get her a table lamp with a rose-colored shade, and
perhaps a rose silk table cover to go with it.&nbsp; Dear Anne
Kitchell!&nbsp; I&rsquo;m so glad some rose color is coming into
her life.</p>
<p>What about the Mountain Industries?&nbsp; Is she going to give
up the superintendence of them?&nbsp; If so, who is to take her
place?</p>
<p>You say someone has bought the little bench on Mount Tennyson
that I loved so much.&nbsp; Can it really be so?&nbsp; Of course
I might have expected it, for it was the best building place on
the whole mountain.&nbsp; But, Oh, my spring of sweet water, and
my darling tulip trees&mdash;which it appears aren&rsquo;t mine,
after all, and now never will be.</p>
<p>That was where I was going to build my little shack and hold
open house.&nbsp; Everyone who went by was to be at liberty to
stop there, and I was going to share with them whatever I had,
and to listen to their stories, and to give them comfort.&nbsp;
Now I share nothing.&nbsp; No one tells me anything.&nbsp; I give
comfort to no one.</p>
<p>But there I am, mooning again and making myself sound very
ungrateful in the bargain.&nbsp; <a name="page235"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 235</span>But I&rsquo;ll tell you, Carin,
Uncle David and Aunt Lorena do not really need me.&nbsp; They are
as kind as they can be, and of course we have some very social
and happy hours together, but the whole truth of it is that they
are quite bound up in each other and do not really need anyone
else at all in their lives.&nbsp; Never having had any children,
and having found each other so satisfying, the presence of
another person in the house is more of an interruption than a
satisfaction to them.&nbsp; No, I know I am not needed
here.&nbsp; That realization is growing on me.&nbsp; Perhaps it
is my fault.&nbsp; Maybe I have not made myself needed.&nbsp; But
at any rate, this is the rather melancholy truth.</p>
<p>Yet <i>is</i> it a melancholy truth?&nbsp; Why not cheerfully
face the fact?&nbsp; Why not look the whole situation in the
face?</p>
<p>For, Oh, Carin, there is a place where I am needed.&nbsp; It
is at Lee, at the Mountain Industries.&nbsp; I know that no one
else can look after them as well as I.&nbsp; Who else knows so
many of the mountain people?&nbsp; With whom would they be as
free and friendly as with Azalea McBirney, the waif-girl they saw
grow up among them, the girl they taught to weave and <a
name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>sew and
knit?&nbsp; And now that I have been so much with people of a
different sort, I mean with the friends of my uncle and aunt, I
am fairly well qualified to meet the other sort of people, too,
the visitors to Lee, who are the patrons of the Industries.&nbsp;
Yes, I should feel quite at ease with them now.&nbsp; I think I
would know ways of bringing them and the mountain people
together.</p>
<p>That introduces me to a perfectly beautiful thought!&nbsp;
What is more, it is the first time I have reached it.&nbsp; I am
glad I came across it when I was writing to you, because that
lets you in at the find.&nbsp; It is this: All I have lived and
experienced the last year has simply been a part of my
preparation for doing what I always wanted to do.&nbsp; It has
made me twice as fit as I was before, to be the friend and
teacher of my dear mountain people.&nbsp; Isn&rsquo;t that so,
Sister Carin?&nbsp; Am I not ready now to come back to Lee and
take my place there, and to spin my silver web?&nbsp; Oh, Carin,
now, at last, I can be the woman your dear father and mother
wanted me to be.&nbsp; I can serve the people toward whom I feel
the greatest loyalty&mdash;the people of the mountains, to whom,
for <a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>Mother McBirney&rsquo;s sake, I owe endless
gratitude.&nbsp; But gratitude quite aside, I want to do it for
myself.&nbsp; I want to be helped in helping them.&nbsp; I want
to live in broadening their lives.</p>
<p>So I think I am going to make up my mind to come back to
Lee.</p>
<p>Yes, I think I am.</p>
<p style="text-align:

.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
.</p>
<p>I can feel myself making up my mind!</p>
<p style="text-align:

.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
.</p>
<p>It is made up!</p>
<p>I am going over to Delight Ravanel&rsquo;s to tell her about
it.&nbsp; She will object, and then I can listen to my own
arguments and make myself sure I am doing right.&nbsp; Then I
shall come home and let Uncle David and Aunt Lorena know.</p>
<p>How excited I am!</p>
<p>I have just rung for young James to saddle Bess.&nbsp; Now I
shall put on my riding habit.</p>
<p>Carin, don&rsquo;t you wish you were going to be along?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>Hastily and happily</i>,</p>
<p style="text-align: right"><i>Azalea</i>.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">Monrepos, one hour later.</p>
<p>Carin, Miss Ravanel understands everything.&nbsp; <a
name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 238</span>She says
she will stand by me.&nbsp; She quite agrees that I must do
something, and that I have a right to live my life in my own way,
just so it is not a selfish way.&nbsp; Now, giving up a fortune
for the sake of liberty can&rsquo;t be selfish, can it?&nbsp;
Maybe it can.&nbsp; That is another thing I&rsquo;ll have to
think about.</p>
<p>Because, you understand, do you not, that going back to Lee
will mean going back to freedom?&nbsp; I shall claim my privilege
of giving up the money grandmother left me, and of framing my
life as seems to suit my conscience and desire&mdash;my deep
heart&rsquo;s desire&mdash;the best.&nbsp; That was where I stood
before I went to Europe, and it is where, after all this time, I
still stand.&nbsp; I have tried to see things as my relatives
wished me to, but I have not succeeded.&nbsp; I want to be
myself, to make my own choice in matters that concern my
happiness, and to be free to use my own powers.</p>
<p>Dear Carin, while I was merely considering in a vague,
abstract way whether or not I should be able to marry the man of
Uncle David&rsquo;s choice, it was not so hard.&nbsp; He might,
by some possibility, choose the right man.&nbsp; But that young
man I wrote you of when I was <a name="page239"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 239</span>abroad, is expected here soon.&nbsp;
His father and Uncle David went to the University of Virginia
together, and he is all that Uncle David thinks a man should
be.&nbsp; He is a fine fellow, too, Gerald Hargreaves is.&nbsp; I
concede that.&nbsp; I want him to be happy&mdash;with someone
else.&nbsp; He is cultivated, handsome, rich, gracious and
good-tempered.&nbsp; This recommends him.&nbsp; But it does not
make me love him.&nbsp; It might, only&mdash;</p>
<p>You know of what my <i>only</i> consists.&nbsp; I cannot
forget Keefe.&nbsp; I never hear from him.&nbsp; I no longer even
write to Mary Cecily, his sister.&nbsp; She stopped writing me,
first, and I inferred that Keefe had, in his pride and sadness,
asked her to do so.&nbsp; He would not have any roundabout
communications.&nbsp; He would hear from me straight or not at
all.&nbsp; So of course I stopped writing.</p>
<p>Yet I feel that he remembers.&nbsp; Oh, Carin, I feel that he
does.&nbsp; But whether he does or not really makes no
difference.&nbsp; I must be true to my own heart, and that will
not let me say &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; to any man save
Keefe.</p>
<p>If I were the old-fashioned sort of a girl, I suppose I should
not be writing in this way, so <a name="page240"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 240</span>frankly and unashamed.&nbsp; But
what have I to be ashamed of?&nbsp; I cannot think it is wrong to
love Keefe.&nbsp; It seems the rightest thing in the world to
me.&nbsp; I feel no confusion of any sort about it.&nbsp; I know
my own mind.&nbsp; I can look in it as if it were a nice clean
mirror, and I see Keefe there every time.</p>
<p>I have just told Delight Ravanel all this.&nbsp; And what do
you think she did?&nbsp; She kissed me!&nbsp; I had looked for a
sharp scolding.</p>
<p>So I am going back home greatly cheered and
strengthened.&nbsp; Yet I realize that it is a hard task I have
before me&mdash;the hardest that ever has come to me.&nbsp; How I
do hope I shall prove myself brave.&nbsp; I want to be brave more
than anything.&nbsp; I mustn&rsquo;t cry!&nbsp; I won&rsquo;t
cry!&nbsp; It is too important a matter to cry about.</p>
<p>Miss Ravanel says she will come to Lee to visit me.&nbsp; She
hasn&rsquo;t been anywhere for twelve years, except to Charleston
now and then, and sometimes to a distant neighbor&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
I want her to come and show my mountain women how to make blue
and white work.&nbsp; It is a kind of embroidery and lace
combined, made on a linen base.&nbsp; She says she will.&nbsp;
Isn&rsquo;t she a dear?&nbsp; I hope you&rsquo;ll not mind her
wrinkles <a name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
241</span>and think her old.&nbsp; She looks a little old, but
she&rsquo;s really very young, judged by the things that
count.</p>
<p>Well, she has given me encouragement and tea and sponge cake
and this beautiful promise to come and visit me in what she calls
my exile.&nbsp; Exile!&nbsp; In Lee!&nbsp; Near you and all the
others I love best.&nbsp; The only drawback to the whole thing
will be seeing somebody else&rsquo;s house go up on my treasured
building site.&nbsp; I do hope to goodness that whoever is
building it will put up a charming house.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t
stand it to see an ugly one there.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing this while Miss Delight is down contracting
with a man for six live turkeys.&nbsp; I can&rsquo;t imagine what
she is going to do with them.&nbsp; How could she eat them all by
herself, or even with her servants to help?&nbsp; There are only
two and neither has any teeth to speak of.&nbsp; Perhaps she
likes to hear turkeys gobble.&nbsp; I agree with her that it is a
cheerful sound.</p>
<p>Well, she is returning.&nbsp; Farewell.&nbsp; I will have Miss
Ravanel&rsquo;s man mail this letter for me.</p>

<p><i>My Carin</i>:</p>
<p>It is done, my dear, it is done.&nbsp; I am free.&nbsp; And
the getting of the freedom has not been so terrible as I feared
it would be.</p>
<p>I went home from Miss Ravanel&rsquo;s that afternoon with my
courage, as you remember, screwed to the sticking point.&nbsp; It
was a glorious afternoon, Carin, and although the summer was
gone, everywhere there were things to remind me of how plenteous
it had been.&nbsp; I had not ridden far before I came to the Knox
estate, which is marked by low stone posts with the letter
&ldquo;K&rdquo; upon the top.&nbsp; The sunshine was over
everything&mdash;over the wide, well-kept fields, the beautiful
woodlands, the creeks, the broad, noisy shallows, the winding
roads, the houses of the tenants and the noble structure of
Mallowbanks.&nbsp; If ever there was a fair domain it is
this.&nbsp; And half of it is mine&mdash;or was mine.&nbsp; I
have given it up&mdash;resigned all claim to it.&nbsp; I can
hardly realize it yet.&nbsp; But I must soon set my hand to
certain signatures, and then my sacrifice will be made regular
and legal, and Azalea will go out of this house as poor as when
she entered it.&nbsp; <a name="page243"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 243</span>Almost, that is.&nbsp; For it is
true that I shall have an annuity which will last as long as I
do, and will provide for my needs.&nbsp; Once, I suppose, I would
have called that a fortune.&nbsp; But it seems very little
now.&nbsp; Since I came here, I have spent more a month on gifts
than this will come to.</p>
<p>But never mind all that.&nbsp; I must tell you what
happened.&nbsp; As I said, it was a glorious afternoon, and I
found my uncle and aunt sitting in the great hallway before a
fire, laughing and talking together very happily.&nbsp; When I
saw how contented they were with each other, and how perfectly
they fitted into that beautiful home, I was able to comfort
myself by thinking of all they had to make their life rich.&nbsp;
They did not, as I have so often said, really need me.</p>
<p>So, without even waiting to change from my habit to my house
garments, I went up to them and kissed them both, and then I
stood by the side of the great fireplace and prayed for the right
words to come.&nbsp; All I could think of was this&mdash;or
something like this:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle David,&rdquo; I began, &ldquo;Aunt Lorena, I have
come to say something very important.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>Uncle
David looked up sharply.&nbsp; I had had a letter that morning
from Gerald Hargreaves and he knew it.&nbsp; I think he thought
that what I had to say related to that.&nbsp; So I shook my head
at him, and he knew I had been reading his thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has to do,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;with a princess who
was not fit to be a princess.&nbsp; She was a princess with a
very queer life.&nbsp; She had her high inheritance, but she was
born in poverty for all of that, and she was reared in poverty,
and in the days when she was poor she used to dream that some day
her kingdom would be given to her, and that she would find her
own people and live with them, beloved and loving.&nbsp; There
was no reason to suppose this dream would ever come true, and
certainly the princess never supposed it would.&nbsp; Dreaming
the dream was just a game that she played to pass away the
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then, one day, by the strangest chance, her people
found her&mdash;her own people&mdash;and so kind and noble were
they that they at once acknowledged her and took her to her own
kingdom&mdash;though it might all have been theirs had they not
been so good and true <a name="page245"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 245</span>that it was a pleasure to them to do
right and to divide it between themselves and her.&nbsp; They did
all they could to make the princess happy.&nbsp; The great house
and the garden, the fields and woods, were for her to
enjoy.&nbsp; She was taken on a journey to beautiful lands.&nbsp;
She was given tutors and books, gowns and jewels, a horse after
her own heart and many luxuries which it would take too long to
name.&nbsp; But there was one thing she did not have, and that
was the right to make her own choice of the sort of life she
wished to lead.&nbsp; She must stay within her kingdom, she must
marry the prince that her kin should choose, and she must live as
became one of her rank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now it so happened that the manner in which the
princess had been reared did not make it possible for her to
consent to this, although she wished from the bottom of her heart
to pay full duty to these kind and true kinsmen of hers.&nbsp;
But she had a higher duty yet than that, and that was to be true
to her own soul.&nbsp; Day by day and hour by hour this truth
grew upon her: that it would be a great sin for her not to be
what she was made to be.&nbsp; &lsquo;Be what thou art&rsquo; she
had once read in a <a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
246</span>book.&nbsp; &lsquo;Be what thou art.&rsquo; She could
not forget it.&nbsp; It seemed to her that there was great wisdom
in that saying.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So she has come to tell her dear kinspeople that she
must let the fortune go.&nbsp; The houses and lands, the streams
and forests, are dear to her, but they are not so dear as
liberty.&nbsp; No, not nearly so dear.&nbsp; But there is one
thing that is dear to her beyond words, and that is the love of
her kinspeople, and that she never means to let go if she can
hold on to it.&nbsp; Whatever the cords are that tied them and
her together, she wants to make stronger and faster, for as long
as she lives she will love them and be grateful to them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yet she must be free.&nbsp; Will they understand, and
forgive?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I cried.&nbsp; I said I wouldn&rsquo;t, that I
mustn&rsquo;t; but I did.&nbsp; Not with sobs.&nbsp; No, but
those miserable tears simply poured out of my eyes over my cheeks
and I couldn&rsquo;t stop them.&nbsp; And Aunt Lorena cried,
too.&nbsp; Only she cried slowly.&nbsp; She sat with her long
hands clasped and let the big, lazy tears roll down her
cheeks.&nbsp; As for Uncle David, he grew red and then white, and
for what seemed a long time I stood <a name="page247"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 247</span>there, waiting, until after a long
time Uncle David said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to me, child,&rdquo; and I went to him, and
kneeled down by him, and he brushed back my hair and kissed me on
the forehead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were never,&rdquo; he said in a voice that trembled
a little, &ldquo;so true a Knox as you are to-day, my
dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Oh, Carin, wasn&rsquo;t that beautiful?&nbsp; I had been
afraid of his disapproval, but now I seemed, in a way I cannot
describe, almost more afraid of his approval.&nbsp; It was hard
for me to stand his kindness when I had been so determined to go
my way.</p>
<p>Then I heard Aunt Lorena talking, but for a moment or two my
heart and brain were in such an uproar that I could not really
make out what she was saying.&nbsp; But at last the words got
through to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know, Azalea, many things which you, perhaps, do not
give us credit for knowing.&nbsp; We know that you are full of
ambition and that the life here seems meaningless to you.&nbsp;
Life has trained you in a different school from what it has
us.&nbsp; We believe if you had waited, you would have come to
see opportunities for <a name="page248"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 248</span>great good in this life here, but
since it truly does not appeal to you, I for one think you ought
to be allowed to go your way and live the life you like.&nbsp; I
know&mdash;we know&mdash;that there lies behind this resolution
your determination to have a free choice in other matters than
your vocation.&nbsp; Am I not right in this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; I said, and found the courage to look
straight into her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not blame you,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
married the man I loved, and I believe every woman should do that
if she can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any price?&rdquo; asked Uncle David, looking first
at me and then at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, at any price consistent with honor,&rdquo; she
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The price you pay is a large one,&rdquo; he said to
me.&nbsp; &ldquo;I doubt if you appreciate how large.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would mean nothing to me if my heart always hung
heavily in me,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he agreed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; echoed Aunt Lorena.</p>
<p>They are very tender with me.&nbsp; They deeply regret the
conditions of the will, but they have no power to change
them.&nbsp; As for me, I do not wish any change made.&nbsp; I
want all left <a name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
249</span>as my little grandmother desired.&nbsp; I resent
nothing.&nbsp; I have too much for which to be thankful.</p>
<p>Carin, it seems incredible, but in a few days I shall be at
Lee.&nbsp; I will wire you when I am coming.&nbsp; Ride up to see
Mother McBirney.&nbsp; Let her know everything.&nbsp; Tell
everyone I am coming home.&nbsp; Oh, how my heart beats at
thought of it!&nbsp; I can write no more.&nbsp; I cannot see my
page for these silly tears.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">&ldquo;WHERE THERE IS A
WILL&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: right">The Shoals, November 24.</p>
<p><i>Dear Aunt Lorena and Dear Uncle David</i>:</p>
<p>Just a line to say that I am safe here and am sending Semmy
back to you with many, many thanks.&nbsp; She asked to stay with
me, but it was, I fancy, more to compliment me than for any other
reason.&nbsp; I would not keep her, of course.&nbsp; She belongs
to Mallowbanks, does dear good Greenville Female Seminary
Simms.&nbsp; May heaven bless her.&nbsp; I hated to part with
her.</p>
<p>Dear me, how many kinds of homesickness one may have.&nbsp;
When I was away from Lee I was longing for it; now that I am here
I love to dream of Mallowbanks.&nbsp; Still, I am glad I am
here.&nbsp; There is work awaiting me.&nbsp; In fact, it is piled
high, and someone was desperately needed to take hold of
it.&nbsp; Lee is bulging with nice visitors with <a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>fashionable-looking purses, and they are wild to do
things and spend money.&nbsp; They would rather purchase these
mountain products than anything else, because they are such
quaint souvenirs of this lovely place.&nbsp; But, alas, all is in
confusion in the little shop.&nbsp; The weavers have been lazy,
the basket-makers must have been wool gathering, the pottery
makers have all been getting married&mdash;just like Ma
Kitchell&mdash;and there is, to say the least, the dickens to
pay.</p>
<p>Mr. and Mrs. Carson had been most eager to have me come back
and take up the work, but as you know, there was not a hint from
them that they wanted me, because, of course, they would not in
any way interfere with me, nor tempt me to return.&nbsp; Anyway,
I do not suppose they had the faintest idea that I would do
so.&nbsp; But when they found that I was willing and ready to
take up the work, they were simply delighted, and now they are
doing everything in their power to help my task along.&nbsp;
Within two or three weeks I hope to have things running very
well.&nbsp; I would like to make a good showing before
Christmas.</p>
<p>I am staying with my own Carin Carson for the present, because
I am not inclined to <a name="page252"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 252</span>take the long ride up and down the
mountain.&nbsp; It would be too exhausting.&nbsp; Moreover, since
I would not be able to help Mother McBirney with the housework, I
would very much object to staying there and making her extra
trouble.&nbsp; But of course I went up there the day after I
arrived.&nbsp; Things are going on quite in the old way with the
McBirneys.&nbsp; Except, of course, that Jim is not there, being
still at school.&nbsp; Hi Kitchell&rsquo;s younger brother is a
helper for Father McBirney, and seems a fine, willing boy.&nbsp;
Father McBirney is pretty well, considering his condition of a
year ago, but he will never be quite so strong and nimble as he
once was.&nbsp; Mother McBirney is well and happy in her quiet
way, and she sends her respects to you.</p>
<p>I am asking a few friends for subscriptions for the
Industries.&nbsp; It would not become me to place any limit on
their generosity, would it?</p>
<p>Oh, what an impertinent one I am to badger you, when you have
already done so much for me!</p>
<p>How am I to thank you for everything?&nbsp; How, above all, am
I to express my gratitude <a name="page253"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 253</span>to you for your large-minded
consideration for my feelings and preferences?&nbsp; I am now a
worker in the world of workers, and I am very happy, for a deep
need of my being is finding expression.&nbsp; Try to understand
as well as to forgive.</p>

<div class="gapmediumline">&nbsp;</div>
<p style="text-align: right">The Shoals, December 5.</p>
<p><i>Dearest Miss Delight</i>, <i>my own beloved twenty-seventh
cousin</i>:</p>
<p>Oh, why do you not come to see me?&nbsp; You thought you might
come along in a week or two.&nbsp; It is more than a week or two
and you are not here.&nbsp; I am having such fun, but it would be
yet more fun if you were sharing it with me.</p>
<p>I am selling things!</p>
<p>Yes, selling them at the Mountain Industries.</p>
<p>They are going like hot cakes.&nbsp; I haven&rsquo;t made up
my books yet, but from present indications I should say that the
Mountain Industries would presently be very, very rich.&nbsp; Of
course I&rsquo;m really not a good judge, because <a
name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 254</span>this is the
first selling I ever have done, and it may have excited me a
bit.</p>
<p>Let me tell you what I have been doing.&nbsp; As I mentioned
in the little note I wrote you, things were rather at sixes and
sevens here.&nbsp; Mrs. Kitchell, who has had charge of the place
from the very beginning, was a fine worker and was and is one of
the dearest little things that ever lived, but she wasn&rsquo;t
just the person for managing a growing business.&nbsp; She was
better at weaving than at negotiating the weaving of other folk,
for example.&nbsp; Actually, when I came to look things over I
found quantities of fine saleable stuff tucked away here and
there.&nbsp; No one ever had come in and demanded those
particular things&mdash;not knowing of the existence of
them&mdash;and they had therefore remained unsold.</p>
<p>I had the whole &ldquo;kit an&rsquo; bilin&rsquo;&rdquo; taken
out in the yard and spread around on bushes and fences and the
ground and aired and <i>aired</i> and <i>aired</i>!&nbsp; Then I
had the salesroom calcimined a most magnificent pumpkin
color.&nbsp; The decorator was as stupid as a rabbit about mixing
the right color, so Carin came over and did it.&nbsp; Then I had
racks put around the wall.&nbsp; Some <a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>of them hung from the ceiling; some
stood on the floor.&nbsp; Also I had a few drawers and shelves
put up, and I got some show cases with black finishings, and I
furnished the room with mountain furniture stained black.&nbsp;
Also I have the floor covered with extra heavy rag carpeting in
pumpkin yellow and black.</p>
<p>Fancy, if you please, how beautiful my blue hand-woven
coverlets and my brown-and-orange and black-and-red counterpanes
look against this wall.&nbsp; Fancy how attractive is the snarl
of fine hand-woven baskets that I have tied up on one side of the
room.</p>
<p>What is more, we are now opening a regular tea room.&nbsp;
Mrs. Kitchell had had one at the beginning, but it had fallen
into nothingness.&nbsp; Now I have one&mdash;the darlingest
room&mdash;all in golden brown and white.&nbsp; It complements
the other room in the nicest way, and yet is very different
indeed.&nbsp; I have some curious Japanese dishes, sort of
crackled in effect, white and brown, and odd serving dishes in
dull yellow majolica.&nbsp; And we use the mountain-made trays of
willow and some of the mountain pottery.&nbsp; I have three neat,
sweet, fleet mountain girls in here helping with the <a
name="page256"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 256</span>tea room,
and people simply throng to it.&nbsp; I write out the little menu
every morning before I get out of bed, and one of these girls,
who really has a head on her, prepares the things in the most
appetizing manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People,&rdquo; I said to her, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t come
in here because they are hungry.&nbsp; They come because they
want to be amused.&nbsp; And they won&rsquo;t be amused unless
everything looks beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Carin is doing a lot of the cooking.&nbsp; She is doing it
because she wants to know how to cook.&nbsp; She is going to be
married before spring, and there is simply no use in her trying
to do anything in her own kitchen.&nbsp; The servants won&rsquo;t
let her; or if they do consent they all stand around and watch
till she is so nervous she can&rsquo;t do a thing.&nbsp; But over
in our kitchen she can do just what she pleases.&nbsp; She makes
those delicious little cakes called &ldquo;hermits&rdquo; and
&ldquo;marguerites&rdquo; and &ldquo;rocks&rdquo; and her
sandwiches are as good to look at as they are to taste.&nbsp; She
has a new kind every day.</p>
<p>I am terribly stern with her about keeping books, however, and
she has to put down every cent she spends.&nbsp; The tea room
must make <a name="page257"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
257</span>money for us or we&rsquo;ll not run it.&nbsp; I have
become fiercely practical.</p>
<p>Oh, how light my heart is!&nbsp; There is so much to do each
day that I can hardly get through, and I fall asleep as soon as I
touch the bed, and am oblivious to the whole world until my alarm
goes off.&nbsp; But I set my alarm pretty early because each day
I must think out my work before I get up.&nbsp; I write out my
program for the day and insist on following it.</p>
<p>Of course quantities and quantities of people come in the shop
who do not purchase, but I do not waste much time with
them.&nbsp; I have a little sign on the wall telling our patrons
to look around as much as they please, and when they have made
their selection to let us know.&nbsp; I add that they are most
welcome; whether they purchase or no, they are to make themselves
at home.</p>
<p>Meantime, I have a pleasant young girl at hand ready to wait
on them when they wish her to, and I, though I appear to be busy
with other matters, keep an ear cocked, and if she seems to need
reinforcing, I come to her assistance.&nbsp; By the way, who do
you suppose that girl is?&nbsp; Why, she is Liza Wixon, from
Mount <a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
258</span>Hebron, the girl whose soup I sampled so generously
without invitation.&nbsp; I have persuaded both her mother and
her to come down and help me.&nbsp; So they have put their
sadness behind them and are working like good fellows.&nbsp; Of
course they have a secret of some kind, but I shall never ask
what it is.</p>
<p>I am sending off letters to our workers, begging them to
hasten their wares to us, telling them the demand for their work
is here.&nbsp; All we need is the goods.</p>
<p>No, I don&rsquo;t go anywhere.&nbsp; Do you wish I
would?&nbsp; When I first came home people began giving me teas
and all that, but I begged them not to.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come and see me Sunday afternoons,&rdquo; I told
them.&nbsp; &ldquo;I mustn&rsquo;t indulge in a social
life.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t have time and strength for that
along with all my work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I knew the people who really cared for me would come, and as
for the others, it would be better for them to visit their chosen
friends and not bother with me.</p>
<p>Well, why don&rsquo;t you come to visit me and to help me with
the Christmas trade?&nbsp; Wouldn&rsquo;t it be the joy of the
world to see <a name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
259</span>the exclusive Miss Delight Ravanel waiting on people
and wearing a pleasant saleslady&rsquo;s smile?&nbsp; It would
fill me with great glee.&nbsp; Please come down here and let me
see you doing it.</p>
<p>Do you miss me?&nbsp; I miss you very, very much.&nbsp;
Evenings, when I leave the drawing-room and go up to my own quiet
room, I think of you sitting by yourself, so lady-fine and
peaceful beside your lamp, your busy needles and thoughts going,
and outside the trees sighing and the wind whistling.&nbsp; How
still you can be, dear friend.&nbsp; Is it hard to learn to be as
still as that?</p>
<p>I have been telling Barbara Summers all about you.&nbsp; Of
course she had met you at the time of my coming-out party, but
she couldn&rsquo;t possibly know you&mdash;or even guess
you&mdash;until she had sat with you evening after evening as I
have, in so pleasant a &ldquo;solitude of two&rdquo; and mined
for your treasures of brain and heart.&nbsp; For you hide your
virtues as other people do their faults.</p>
<p>Dear Delight R., I have had occasion whenever I went to Mother
McBirney&rsquo;s, to go by the place I used to call mine.&nbsp; I
mean that <a name="page260"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
260</span>little, out-looking bench on the mountain-side where
the tulip trees rustle and the spring of cold water
whispers.&nbsp; I have already told you that a house is going up
there.&nbsp; Well, it is beginning really to look like a house
now, and I cannot resist dismounting every time I pass it, and
looking it over.</p>
<p>It is going to be a bewitching house, nothing less.&nbsp;
There is a covered porch which in winter is to be made into a sun
room, that literally hangs over the blue abyss, but so firmly is
it supported with its foundations of cement and its huge beams of
oak, that it is as firm and enduring as the mountain-side
itself.&nbsp; There is a long, fine living room; the mantel is to
be of blue tile&mdash;yes, and the chimney piece, too.&nbsp; It
will be curious, will it not?&nbsp; But I think I shall like
it.&nbsp; There are two bedrooms on the first floor, and there
is, of course, the kitchen and a small dining room.&nbsp; The
wood is chestnut, which takes on a beautiful color when it is
oiled.</p>
<p>Upstairs there is a bedroom which reminds me of my dear little
loft at Mother McBirney&rsquo;s only that it is, of course, to be
very nicely finished off.&nbsp; It looks up the mountain-side,
too, <a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 261</span>and
it opens on a sleeping porch.&nbsp; Then there is a long room
beside it, the use of which I do not know.&nbsp; Perhaps it is
being left undivided merely because it is not needed for present
use.&nbsp; I have asked a number of persons who is building this
house, but no one seems to know.&nbsp; The contractor is a friend
of mine, but even he professes to know nothing.&nbsp; He says
that a man at Rutherford is doing all the business with him, but
that he understands it is for some gentleman who wishes to have a
quiet spot to come to now and then, and who once visited Lee and
saw this beautiful building site.</p>
<p>Well, if he had taken any other spot in the whole county
except the particular one that he did, he would be welcome.&nbsp;
But as it is, he annoys me.</p>
<p>Haven&rsquo;t I chattered about enough?&nbsp; Mind, I am
looking for you.&nbsp; I want you to come down and play at being
a &ldquo;rich merchant&rdquo; with me.</p>
<p>If you see the good people at Mallowbanks, give them my love,
please.</p>

<p><i>Dear Aunt Lorena</i>:</p>
<p>I have just come home from the wedding of my dear Annie Laurie
Pace to Samuel Disbrow.&nbsp; It was quite a sudden affair at the
last.&nbsp; Of course they have been in love with each other for
years, and it must be a year and a half since they became
engaged.&nbsp; But they were both so busy superintending the
dairy which Annie Laurie&rsquo;s father left her, and following
up their university extension course, that we had about decided,
Carin and I, that they had forgotten all about getting
married.</p>
<p>But it seems that we were mistaken.&nbsp; They were thinking
about it all of the time.</p>
<p>The wedding was held in the Baptist church, and there were
three ministers to make it what it should be.&nbsp; There was the
Baptist minister, who belonged there, and the Methodist
minister&mdash;Mr. Summers&mdash;who helped because Annie Laurie
loved him, and there was old Mr. Mills, who came back from
Florida to put on the finishing touches, because Annie Laurie had
known him ever since she was a baby.</p>
<p><a name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>She
looked glorious, did Annie Laurie, so tall and strong and fine,
with her dark red hair burnished like a bird&rsquo;s breast, all
in her white, with her floating veil.&nbsp; Instead of
bride&rsquo;s roses she carried a bouquet of great tawny
chrysanthemums the color of her hair.&nbsp; Sam has grown to be a
magnificent fellow and everyone likes him.&nbsp; When I remember
what a pale-faced, anxious boy he was once, and see what a
strong, capable, independent fellow he has become, I feel
tremendously proud, not only of him, but of Lee, which helped him
to make himself what he is.&nbsp; There was a time when everybody
thought him the son of a thief, and when he was broken-hearted
with grief and shame, when he might have gone down and become
worse than nothing.&nbsp; But he wanted to be good and fine, and
everybody in Lee turned in and gave him a boost.&nbsp; Annie
Laurie helped most of all, of course.</p>
<p>Now she has her reward.</p>
<p>They have gone away on a wedding trip, and I am so glad.&nbsp;
Never before has either of them gone outside of the state they
were born in.&nbsp; But now she and Sam are off to the North, and
will visit New York and Boston, <a name="page264"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 264</span>Washington and Baltimore, and a
number of other places.&nbsp; Fortunately, they have a good
superintendent, and the dairy will get on very well without
them.&nbsp; I am going to stay in the house with Annie
Laurie&rsquo;s two aunts until she returns.&nbsp; Aunt Adnah is
very restless, and Aunt Zillah cannot manage her very well, but
when I am there I can, I think, keep them amused.&nbsp; I move
over to-morrow, and shall stay in Annie Laurie&rsquo;s own room,
which is as clean, if not as bare, as in the old days when I knew
it first.</p>
<p>How Annie Laurie did want dear old Haystack Thompson to play
at the little dance after the wedding!&nbsp; But he is not to be
found.&nbsp; Never since he ran away from good little Mrs.
Kitchell has he been seen or heard of.&nbsp; But I can&rsquo;t
believe that any harm has come to him.&nbsp; He is off in some
other part of his beloved mountains, fiddling for new
friends.&nbsp; I miss him terribly.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t think me
egotistical, but I do wonder if he would return if he knew that I
was back here.&nbsp; He always loved me quite out of proportion
to my deserts.&nbsp; It was because he helped to find me that
time I was kidnapped, I think, and because I was <a
name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 265</span>such a
queer, unlucky little girl and needed him so much.&nbsp; But
whatever the reason, we are great friends, and I can not think of
anything that would give me greater pleasure than to see him
loping down the mountain-side, with his fiddle under his arm, and
his hair all in a shock, like a windblown haystack.</p>
<p>I had no time to prepare a fit present for Annie Laurie, the
announcement of her wedding was so unexpected.&nbsp; So now I am
weaving a counterpane for her of blue, orange and white in the
wheel and star pattern.&nbsp; It is going to be beautiful, and
will bring color into her room, which always has been too
austere.&nbsp; Carin has ordered a beautiful rug from New York,
which will have the same colors in it.&nbsp; And Mrs. Carson will
give the hangings of blue for the windows.&nbsp; So we shall have
a charming room for her by the time she returns.&nbsp; The truth
is, Annie Laurie never pays any attention to herself or to the
things which she alone uses, beyond keeping everything spotlessly
clean and in order after the immemorial fashion of the Paces.</p>
<p>But she deserves a beautiful bedroom, and she shall have
it.</p>
<p><a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 266</span>I am
so busy in the shop during the day that I have to weave the
counterpane at night.&nbsp; I might have someone else do it, only
I prefer to do it with my own hands.&nbsp; Anyway, I have to
economize a bit.&nbsp; Not that I mind.&nbsp; Which reminds me
that the first installment of the annuity dear grandmother
provided for me, arrived safely.&nbsp; Enclosed please find
receipt.&nbsp; Mr. Carson is paying me a nice little salary for
my work at the Industries.&nbsp; So I am well provided for, as
you see.&nbsp; But I want to be a bit saving, because now,
indeed, Azalea is out for herself, and she does not want to have
to fall back on anybody.</p>
<p>I am sorry Uncle David does not write me.&nbsp; He isn&rsquo;t
vexed with me, is he?&nbsp; Oh, I know he is disappointed.&nbsp;
I know I seem to him not to have done the right or the grateful
thing.&nbsp; But try to make him understand that I love
him.&nbsp; I had to go my own way, that is all.&nbsp; And I am
justified; I feel that in my heart.&nbsp; I enjoy each moment as
it comes, and I continually feel that something yet more glorious
is about to happen.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">&ldquo;RING, HAPPY
BELLS&rdquo;</span></h2>
<p style="text-align: right">The Shoals, December 26.</p>
<p><i>My dear</i>, <i>dear Uncle and Aunt</i>:</p>
<p>A happy New Year!&nbsp; Was it a merry Christmas for
you?&nbsp; Oh, I hope it was.&nbsp; You had many of your kith and
kin with you, I know.&nbsp; I would have liked to have been there
if only I could have been in two places at once.&nbsp; But you
know how difficult that is.</p>
<p>And this year I had to be right here.</p>
<p>You still wonder why?</p>
<p>It is not easy to explain.&nbsp; But it had to be.&nbsp; I
felt the need of it.&nbsp; I have been working my way back to the
true, original Azalea, and she was to be found here and not amid
all the luxury and quietude and tradition of Mallowbanks.&nbsp;
But now, I think, at last, she is really found, and so she hopes
that next year you may be able to include her in your Christmas
celebration.</p>
<p><a name="page268"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 268</span>Let
me thank you and then thank you again for your beautiful
Christmas gifts.&nbsp; A piano of my own, and a music cabinet and
folios and folios of music!&nbsp; It was a royal gift and I do
not see just how ordinary thanks are going to express my
gratitude.&nbsp; All I can say is that it shall be the comfort of
my lonely hours, and the joy of my bright ones, and that I
promise now that never shall I sit down to this exquisite
instrument without thinking of the two who gave it to me, and
being thankful that my life met theirs.&nbsp; That my life and
theirs could not, for reasons, run along in the same channel,
makes the joy of the meeting no less.&nbsp; I look at this
wonderful gift and find myself not quite believing that it is
really mine.&nbsp; This morning I could hardly wait to dress to
run into Carin&rsquo;s studio to see if it really was
there.&nbsp; Having no place of my own, I have had it put in her
lovely room for the time being.</p>
<p>I have many things to tell you, and I am going to try to tell
them with proper dignity as becomes your niece.&nbsp; I know I
write dreadful nonsense at times, and I know, too, that I am too
impulsive and enthusiastic.&nbsp; I <a name="page269"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 269</span>remember that dear Father McBirney
warned me against those faults in my character years ago, when I
first came to him.&nbsp; I am afraid I have not improved very
much, but at least I am aware that he was right, and that I ought
to be a more sober and calm person than I am.</p>
<p>So, quite calmly and soberly, I am happier than I ever thought
anybody could be.&nbsp; I have promised Keefe O&rsquo;Connor to
marry him.&nbsp; By Spring I shall have done it&mdash;and you two
shall be here beside me, to deliver me with all possible
conventionality into his hands.</p>
<p>There!&nbsp; Did I not tell that soberly enough?</p>
<p>And now to go back!</p>
<p>I did not write to Keefe nor he to me.&nbsp; We had promised
you that we would not, and we kept our word.&nbsp; I did not even
let him know that I was here at Lee, or that I had renounced all
of my right to my grandmother&rsquo;s splendid legacy in order to
be free to weave my own silver web.&nbsp; No, I just worked and
kept still.</p>
<p>But I confess that I knew that Annie Laurie had written to
Keefe&rsquo;s sister, Mrs. Rowantree, all about it, and that I
was morally sure she would write to Keefe.&nbsp; But that, as you
will <a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
270</span>plainly see, was something over which I had no
control.&nbsp; Not, I will confess, that I tried to have.</p>
<p>Meantime, I tried to be content, and I was, really, but it was
a contentment made up largely of expectation.&nbsp; You see how
frank I am with you.&nbsp; Do you mind?&nbsp; It is
Azalea&rsquo;s way.&nbsp; You don&rsquo;t want her to try to be
any other way than is natural to her, do you?</p>
<p>Yes, I had a beautiful, deep-down, reassuring sense of
expectation.&nbsp; I felt as if Happiness was journeying toward
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; I often said to myself, &ldquo;she will
be a long while coming, but she is on the way.&nbsp; By putting
my ear to the ground, I am sure I can hear her
footsteps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I kept on working and working, and the work thrived and I
thrived.&nbsp; At night I slept the sleep of the very weary, and
all day long I was playing the fine exciting game of building up
the business of the Mountain Industries.</p>
<p>Then, when I had nothing else to do, I dreamed dreams.</p>
<p>There was only one thing in the world that bothered me, and
that was the little house up <a name="page271"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 271</span>on the mountain.&nbsp; It seemed too
outrageous that anybody&mdash;a stranger at that&mdash;should
have come down into the Blue Ridge and bought and built on the
one spot of all the whole range that I had selected for
myself.&nbsp; To add insult to injury, he was putting up
precisely, identically, the sort of a house that I had designed
for the place.&nbsp; There was only one way to account for that,
and that was that both he and I had selected the most appropriate
sort of a house for the place.&nbsp; Such a house, I finally
decided, must be inevitable in such a spot.&nbsp; And yet, after
all, that didn&rsquo;t quite account for the strangeness of the
fact that the place was such a materialization of my dream.&nbsp;
It really annoyed me.&nbsp; I did not like that man.&nbsp; I was
prepared to be disagreeable to him.</p>
<p>And then, one day, I saw him.</p>
<p>It was a Sunday, clear and crisp and cold, and I had been up
to have dinner with Mother McBirney.&nbsp; Jim was home, too, for
the holidays, and the four of us sat in the quaint, dear old room
just as we used years ago.&nbsp; Only now it was Jim and not
Father McBirney who said grace at table.&nbsp; It was he who <a
name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 272</span>carved the
turkey too.&nbsp; For it was a feast, and we ate one of the
turkeys which usually are kept for market.&nbsp; But nothing is
too good for Jim, home from college.&nbsp; Or for Azalea, who is
keeping him there.</p>
<p>Yes, turkey we had, and yams cooked in sugar and wild crab
apple jelly and green tomato pickles and molasses bread and
biscuits and gravy, and coffee and &ldquo;stickies&rdquo; for
dessert.&nbsp; To make stickies, you make a pie crust and roll
brown sugar in it.&nbsp; You are always glad when you see them
and sorry after you have eaten them.&nbsp; Ma makes the best ones
in the South.&nbsp; Oh, yes, we were very happy.&nbsp; The fire
leaped in the old black fireplace, and the hounds curled up
before it and whined with joy.&nbsp; Ma was a dream in her blue
dress and white apron with her dear face shining with goodness
and love, and Pa McBirney was a picture with his whitening
hair.&nbsp; Outside the mountain dreamed and dreamed, and told us
how long mountains lived, and what a little while mere folks had
for enjoying themselves, and warned us to gather up all the
sweetness we could while we have a chance.</p>
<p><a name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>So we
did.&nbsp; We ate and laughed and were glad together; we tidied
the little house and then we sang and read.&nbsp; But all the
time I noticed Mother looking at me in a new way, and sometimes
the tears would come to her eyes, and it seemed as if she never
passed me without dropping a hand on my head or my
shoulder.&nbsp; And Jim was tender too.&nbsp; He neither teased
me nor preached to me.&nbsp; He was just sweet.&nbsp; As for Pa,
he asked me if I didn&rsquo;t think all of our ways were laid out
for us by One Who Knew What Was Best.&nbsp; Oh, yes, it surely
was a day long to be remembered.</p>
<p>But it surprised me a little when they urged me to start on my
way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t be out after dark, my dear,&rdquo;
said Mother McBirney, patting my hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;I want to
think of you as safe at the Shoals before the twilight
comes.&nbsp; So you&rsquo;d better be on your way,
honey-girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I want to stay,&rdquo; I pleaded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she laughed, &ldquo;you want to
go.&nbsp; You may not know it, but you do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So among them they got me into my things and onto my
horse.&nbsp; I miss my little Paprika <a name="page274"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 274</span>when I ride these mountain roads,
and sometimes wish I could buy her back again.&nbsp; The horse I
ride is from the Carson stables, of course, and is a fine, gentle
creature which Mrs. Carson often uses and which knows every inch
of the way.</p>
<p>To my surprise, Jim insisted on coming along.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But no,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is the use,
Jim?&nbsp; Stay with the folks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I need exercise, sister,&rdquo; he answered, still in
that surprisingly gentle way.&nbsp; &ldquo;You must let me do
what I like when I am home so seldom.&nbsp; I get discipline
enough at college.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So off we went together, just as we used in the old days when
we were boy and girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you aren&rsquo;t at all
sorry that you chose to be a minister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I never had had a chance to ask him this, seriously, and I was
glad of the opportunity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sis,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;every day of my life I am
more and more thankful that I decided to be one.&nbsp; It is only
that&mdash;only living the best I can and giving all my heart and
life to the service of the God who made this beautiful earth and
our wonderful bodies and <a name="page275"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 275</span>souls&mdash;that can satisfy
me.&nbsp; I must do it.&nbsp; I live in the thought of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked at him as he rode beside me and saw how his face had
strengthened and beautified, and I wondered how such things
happened; how it was that little commonplace teasing boys grew up
to be men like the one beside me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Jim,&rdquo; I cried, holding out my hand to him,
&ldquo;I congratulate you from my deepest heart.&nbsp; I feared
that your taking up of the ministry might be a mood; that you
might change.&nbsp; But now I see you never will.&nbsp; You will
be a tower of strength, brother Jim, and in the years to come
when I am troubled about life, I shall come to you for
help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is you who always have helped me, Zalie,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is you who are making it possible now for
me to prepare for my great work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I write you all this, dear Uncle and Auntie, to show you how
sweet he is and how interesting and peaceful my life is here, so
you&rsquo;ll not be sorry, thinking of all I let go from me.</p>
<p>Well, we went on down the road, looking at the purple valley
with the shafts of smoke <a name="page276"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 276</span>arising straight from the houses
below and towering, silver bright, in the light of the lowering
sun.&nbsp; I was so absorbed with it all that I did not realize
how rapidly we were covering the road, till suddenly I saw we
were beside the house on the bench.</p>
<p>And what do you think?&nbsp; There was a shaft of silvery
smoke arising from that chimney, too, and it was shot through
with little sparks like stars, as if the fire it came from had
been newly lighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;the owner of the house has
come!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had been so happy all day that I forgot to be disagreeable,
and though I had quite made up my mind to dislike this person
intensely, I neglected to do it at that moment, for thinking of
how happy he must be to have come to his beautiful little
house.&nbsp; I wondered too if his wife was with him, and what
she was like.&nbsp; Then I remembered that I had heard he was not
married, and I thought:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can never be lonely amid such beauty.&nbsp; To look
off on a scene like this will be company enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p276.jpg">

</a></p>
<p><a name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>But I
knew that wasn&rsquo;t really so.&nbsp; No beauty, however great,
can comfort one for a lonely hearth; no meal is delicious for
which only one place is set.</p>
<p>Then, out of that purplish gloom and from the shadow of the
porch at the side of the house I heard a voice saying lazily:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you be pleased to &rsquo;light and come
in?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It had the mountain drawl and the mountain way, but there was
something wrong with it, and it made me look inquiringly at
Jim.&nbsp; He was wearing a broad grin&mdash;a perfectly
wonderful, old-time-Jim grin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>Curiosity got hold of me and flung me off that horse and sent
me right up to the stranger on the porch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very kind of you,&rdquo; I said in a fine
Mallowbanks manner, &ldquo;and we shall be delighted.&nbsp; We
have so long been interested in the building of this beautiful
little house, and we did not know its owner&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then I said no more.</p>
<p>It was Keefe O&rsquo;Connor who stood there holding out his
hands to me.</p>
<p><a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
278</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put up the horses, sis,&rdquo; said
Jim with a little funny break in his voice.&nbsp; And then Keefe
drew me into the lighted room.</p>
<p>You two have been such true lovers for so many years, that I
need tell you nothing about what that moment meant.&nbsp; No, I
need not tell you anything at all.</p>
<p>After a while we went into the long room where the fire was
leaping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;it is perfect!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the room completely suited me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is bare,&rdquo; said Keefe.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I left
the furnishings to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I said nothing.&nbsp; I laughed.&nbsp; It was different from
any other laugh I ever had.&nbsp; I laughed and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is so amusing?&rdquo; asked Keefe at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing is amusing,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
not amused.&nbsp; I am happy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, and then he laughed too.&nbsp; By
and by he asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ought I to have waited longer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall paint here half the year or more,&rdquo; he
explained.&nbsp; &ldquo;Then, when I must, I shall go to the
cities.&nbsp; It will be necessary.&nbsp; I must <a
name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>hold my
exhibits, visit the art academies, see what other men are
doing&mdash;keep in touch with the world.&nbsp; But this shall be
my home&mdash;our home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shall we give it a name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have thought of hundreds and rejected
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps Jim can name it for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We went to look for him and found him star-gazing.&nbsp; His
teeth were beginning to chatter a little, I am afraid, with the
sharp chill of the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jim,&rdquo; I said, giving him a good hug and kiss,
&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you would keep a secret from your
Zalie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dear old Jim!&nbsp; He gave me such a squeeze and let loose a
big, blundering kind of a laugh, and then we brought him in and
we all sat around the fire and talked.&nbsp; I never knew just
how much like a brother he seemed to me till that moment.</p>
<p>We asked him to name the cottage for us, but he could think of
nothing, and then, quite suddenly it came to me.&nbsp; I would
call it &ldquo;Delight Cottage&rdquo; in honor of my own dear
Delight Ravanel.</p>
<p><a name="page280"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
280</span>Don&rsquo;t you agree with me that it is a good
idea?</p>
<p>But I haven&rsquo;t told her yet.&nbsp; I thought I would keep
it a secret until she came to visit me, which will be in a few
days now.&nbsp; Keefe said he would himself make the sign and
place it at the gateway&mdash;the same gateway being nothing less
than two of my beloved tulip trees.</p>
<p>Keefe told me he had come down to finish some paintings, and
that he would go on living right there in the cottage, working on
certain parts of the house himself, such as the staining of the
wood, the making of fire screens and benches for the chimney
side, and various other things.&nbsp; He said there was work
enough to keep him busy in his odd moments for a year or
two.&nbsp; Mrs. Babb is coming over to cook for him and to keep
&ldquo;Delight Cottage&rdquo; tidy.</p>
<p>Well, a little later in the evening Jim started me on my way
again, only this time both he and Keefe were my cavaliers, and I
burst into the drawing-room at the Shoals expecting to give them
the greatest sort of a surprise, but I was vastly
disappointed.&nbsp; They <a name="page281"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 281</span>only laughed at me.&nbsp; They had
known all along that Keefe was building the house, and they had
met him at the train and had taken him up to Delight Cottage
themselves, I all the while toiling away in my shop.&nbsp; He
wanted, it seems, to make the place look as well as it could in
its incomplete state before I saw it.</p>
<p>Ah, what a happy, happy girl I am!&nbsp; Only one thing
troubles me, and that is your possible disapproval.&nbsp; Keefe
is writing you, I believe.&nbsp; He said to me more than
once:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do hope your uncle and aunt are not going to think
that I have done wrong.&nbsp; I have cared more for your
happiness, Azalea, than for anything on earth, and if I had for
one moment believed that you would have been happier if I had
withdrawn myself entirely from your life, I would have done so
without regard to my lifelong loneliness.&nbsp; But when I heard
that you had resigned your inheritance and come back here, I was
forced to conclude that it was a sign and token to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was,&rdquo; I confessed.&nbsp; &ldquo;Just
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well, my dear kinfolk, Christmas came with <a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>all its
pleasures, and it brought me your beautiful gift, also my ring
from Keefe, and lovely things from the Carsons and from many
other friends.&nbsp; Even there were many remembrances from my
mountain people.</p>
<p>There was one gift&mdash;or token, rather&mdash;which filled
me with the greatest surprise.&nbsp; It was a copy of Delight
Ravanel&rsquo;s will, bequeathing to me all of her possessions
when the day comes that she must go into the Other Land.&nbsp;
Oh, I hope it will be many, many years till then!</p>
<p>Try to fancy my amazement.&nbsp; Truly, I never was more
surprised in my life, although, as you know, I have had a good
many surprises for a person of my age.</p>
<p>Moreover, she is coming to see me next week, and in
preparation for her visit I have had Mrs. Kitchell&rsquo;s old
living rooms fitted up all fresh for us.&nbsp; There is a little
sitting room, and a kitchen and two bedrooms.&nbsp; With the help
of my always kind Mrs. Carson, the place has been made&mdash;or
is being made&mdash;as cosy and dainty as you can imagine.&nbsp;
Mrs. Wixon will help me keep house, and I shall be quite
independent and settled.&nbsp; Of course <a
name="page283"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 283</span>Mrs. Carson
and Carin beg me to stay with them, but I feel I have been their
guest quite long enough.&nbsp; Now&mdash;only fancy&mdash;I shall
be able to entertain them at times, and to return in some small
measure the endless hospitality they have shown me.&nbsp; I think
Cousin Delight will love this little experiment in housekeeping,
and I wouldn&rsquo;t be the least surprised to see her taking an
interest in the weaving and basket-making and in the little
shop.&nbsp; It would be the best thing in the world for her if
she would, for life certainly is pretty drowsy at Monrepos, where
she has lived so long alone, remembering and brooding and doing
her little solitary tasks.&nbsp; If I have my way she shall stay
with me or near me altogether.</p>
<p>So you see into what a shining and rapid current my little
life has been swung.&nbsp; And you will forgive me for everything
I did not do and for everything I am doing.&nbsp; I insist on
being forgiven&mdash;and loved.&nbsp; You must love me when I
love you so much.</p>
<p>When I am married you must be my first guests.&nbsp; Until you
come, I shall have no one.&nbsp; I would never be satisfied if
you did not dedicate my house for me by your presence.</p>
<p><a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>The
wedding day is not yet set exactly.&nbsp; It will be in the early
summer, after Keefe has finished some orders he has, and so is
feeling quite rich, and after I have really got the Mountain
Industries in such a condition that I can safely pass them on to
others.&nbsp; Even after I am married I shall keep an overseeing
eye on them, and Mrs. Carson and Carin will help me.&nbsp; Then,
of course, there is my trousseau to make.&nbsp; I am so glad you
let me have dear little madam grandmother&rsquo;s chests.&nbsp; I
think I can make over her wedding dress so that I can wear it,
and of course I shall wear her veil.</p>
<p>If you will send on the portrait that she had painted for me,
I can hang it above my new piano in my little sitting room.&nbsp;
Or shall I hang it above my fireplace?&nbsp; I must try and see
in which place it looks the best.</p>
<p>My heart is singing with joy, and I send you a thousand little
carefully wrapped packages of love.&nbsp; Undo them one by one
and think of</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

cannot be read by your equipment.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
